Well I disagree with nearly everything they stand for but I agree with their right to assemble peacefully and say things I disagree with I think the idea of counter protesting is really just an attempt to escalate situations and I think the mayor acted unlawfully in refusing to uphold their permit and having the police stand down which ultimately led to a bunch of violence that continued to escalate I think that s horribly irresponsible from a public safety perspective ,liberal

It s really easy to say that we shouldn t be concerned with race orientation etc when you re the normal You re effectively telling people to be more white or less black Telling a black guy to be less black or to be more white sounds pretty fucking retarded right Telling people to stop focusing on race is effectively saying the same thing ,liberal

I think a more reasonable reaction to extremist protestors is to have none Just ignore them Let them have their rally and their protest Don t counter protest don t do anything Just leave them be They want somebody to be against If they have no opponent what s the point of protesting Eventually many will lose interest and stop doing it ,liberal

James Madison argues in Federalist 10 that factionalism is the greatest threat to a stable republic The far right in this country has completely lost touch with reality and have spent decades intentionally fostering an environment of fear and tension which in turn has caused the far left to similarly radicalize and embrace violence as legitimate political action I fear that unless we recommit to liberal values and try to reclaim the center the American experiment s days are numbered ,liberal
UPDATE Paul s communications director Sergio Gor provided Mediaite with a statement about the tweet noting that it was sent by a staffer The tweet you reference was part of live tweeting of someone else s speech and it was done by a staffer Those are not Senator Paul s words http www mediaite com online a year ago rand paul tweeted that 2nd amendment exists to shoot at the government ,liberal
Conservative here In my experience most of the folks who beat their chests like that don t have a firm ideological base and are more of a danger to the Republican Party than to their opponents They re using our party and our Constitution as a means to justify their own toxic rhetoric I advocate for textualism when interpreting the Constitution for this precise reason Taken literally you can own a gun and carry it around but people abusing it to trample on another person s right to life except in cases of self defense when they are in immediate danger of being killed themselves is not okay ,liberal

I think the sub s name works fine even into the future It has a touch of never forget style historic irony in that had Sanders been selected to run formally under the DNC standard we would be living in a different country Instead of picking through a ruin we would be reaching for new heights of equality and justice Some of us saw that dream of a country run by it s own people instead of an elite class and now it s up to us to bring the rest of the country around to it The truth is Sanders was our President even before the primary because of his policies we respected him and would do what he asked if we possibly could This feeling is foreign to most Americans as real leadership of this kind has not been seen in an American president since perhaps JFK who asked us to put down cigars and makeup so we could touch the moon So long as Sanders draws breath I believe all of us will likely continue to feel this way out of respect for him as a real leader And real leaders don t need crowns coron,liberal

Well yeah Bernie actually has a growth plan for the Democratic party not to mention his 50 state strategy DWS and HRC don t give a shit about drawing people into the party They prefer to actively exclude people It s why DWS has been a terrible DNC chair and an historic failure and has lost an unprecedented number of seats during her tenure and is about to lose her own It s why the number of Americans identifying as independents has skyrocketed The party is actively losing power and influence through losing and alienating membership Of course Joe Biden by virtue of not being an idiot would prefer to grow the party and attract new membership that supports the ideals the Democratic party claims to hold ,liberal

John Oliver noted a survey which found that Americans are the only people in the world who by and large vote for policies that go against where they are now but benefit them when they get rich in the future American dream delusion at its best I say if you re thinking long term like that put more money in your 401k it s likely to do more than voting that way ,liberal

You re the liar actually The video cuts out the part where there is a question asked to Trump The question was along the line of will you raise the minimum wage So in the context of that question when he said wages are too high he was referring to the minimum wage specifically And more precisely he was speaking against the idea of raising the minimum wage because in the end it gives jobs to other countries Past a certain level you can t force the market to pay high wages it has to go through competition That s his argument So you re just full of shit like the so called reporters ,liberal

Being honest means not taking peoples words out of context even if it does seem to be what you want to imply Trump was asked a question about the minimum wage That means you must assume his response is referring to the minimum wage if he doesn t specify Sanders then claims Trump says wages are too high without mentioning the context that this is referring to the minimum wage only Sanders knows full well that the mainstream conservative position is that the minimum wage is too high because it is government mandated and Sanders also knows full well that everyone in America on both sides supports higher wages in general Sanders WAS being dishonest here when relevant context is taken into account ,liberal

Al Gore tries to remain relevant His new climate change movie looks terrible mainly because how he frames it It also will probably play to the same crowd rather than doing anything relevant ,liberal
To be honest this seems reminiscent of the Republicans voting to repeal the ACA 2 4 years ago when they were in the minority If this were to actually come to a vote with any realistic chance of passing then we d see who actually believes in pursuing the Single Payer option We are seeing it now with the Republicans pushing for a full repeal of the ACA already 8 Senators who previously voted for the repeal bill have stated they would not support it now they were effectively grandstanding granted maybe their opinions have changed in 2 4 years but that seems rather unlikely ,liberal

They aren t bankrupt There is a limit to what you can pay secret service employees through a fiscal year It just so happens that other presidents have run into the same problem This is because it s hard to know the total number of trips you will take where you need protection What trump has done is poorly manage the budget by hiring too many agents AND going on too many trips in a shorter time span than have other presidents This isn t news and doesn t tell us anything we don t already know about trump ,liberal

Here s a response for people trying to discredit James Clapper Here is the clarification from James Clapper Well it might be useful first to explain the unique position that the FBI occupies in that it straddles both intelligence as a part of the intelligence community and law enforcement My practice during the six and a half years that I was at DNI was always to defer to the director of the FBI be it Director Bob Mueller or Director Jim Comey on whether when and what to tell me about a counterintelligence investigation when the possibility was there that this could devolve into some sort of a criminal investigation So I left it to the judgment of the FBI and that was certainly the practice I followed here But that was consistent with what I did during the whole six and a half years So it s not surprising or out of or abnormal that I would not have known about the investigation or even more importantly the content of that investigation So I don t know if there was collusion or not I do,liberal
Everything the Clapper says is a lie so I guess Trump must be actually telling the truth on this one ,liberal
So Clapper lied under oath ,liberal
We are not spying on the American public Clapper ,liberal
Hahahaha ha they re just pissed he fired their buddy comey ,liberal

1518 mass shootings since Sandy hook Did I miss 1400 or more reported on the news ,liberal
Depends on what you consider a mass shooting From what i can tell anything with more than 3 deaths is considered a mass shooting which to me isnt a high enough threshold not saying its ok just feel like 3 is too low to be considered mass shooting Also gun ownership rates are rising and murder rates are going down ,liberal
My argument isn t about safety It s about the validity of the gun control debate and rejecting the idea that the 2nd Amendment should prevent any legislation I gave a rhetorical metaphor using an AR 15 and a 9mm as quick examples However you can substitute any number of guns that are only useful for killing as many people as possible You wanted to know what I felt should be done about your homemade weapon so I gave an example of the debate Congress and the courts should have I asked a question about the why you thought that a 9mm AR 15 should be allowed and you responded with essentially because you like it My point is that you liking it doesn t provide enough justification for you having a weapon that can be fitted with high capacity magazines and provides no value according to the spirit of the 2nd Amendment And there is certainly nothing in the letter of the 2nd that would guarantee your toy so I would vote to ban those Unless of course someone could explain what value these weapons,liberal

Yeah That sucks ,liberal
He is not responsible for the tactical decisions There would be no point in having generals if not to bestow them the responsibility of oversight of militant tactical situations If you boss fired you would you hold the CEO accountable for it These operations take tons of planning and time if the leaders didnt think it was safe they would not have gone forward with it People would not have let it go even if he had taken full responsibility just another brilliant ploy at a direct attack on his character whilst never having met the man good job internet warriors ,liberal
He blamed Obama too when Obama said several times to the generals not do do the raid ,liberal
So by the statements made from Trump in the article anything Trump does while in office is Obama s fault Oh I m sorry it s only the BAD stuff that is Obama s fault s ,liberal
I dont get paid to be here ,liberal
Let me start by saying I M NOT A TRUMP SUPPORTER I m just a lover of truth Here yours is wrong Trump is no more responsible for the failed operation than Obama is for killing Bin Laden The military generals and entire chain of service members involved made the plans in both operations I mentioned organized the personnel and logistics prepared everything necessary and presented the plan to the POTUS at the time The POTUS then deferred to the judgement rightfully so of his generals and ordered the operations to proceed Neither operation was the fault or the success of either POTUS Wake up people pay attention here please ,liberal
This subreddit is cancer ,liberal
What was the details of the mission Trump advised by any military advisers on if it should be done Just curious as it seems strange for a president to think up a mission prepare it do all the intelligence himself etc Usually all of that is done and he is bought the suggestion by military heads of what he should do Did he go against advice that he shouldn t send the raid Or did he follow long standing military heads advice ,liberal

I ve seen so many posts and comments by people who are annoyed at the results of this special election And I m sure that Trump s supporters feel like they were vinticated But it should actually be the other way around For those who don t know places like Montana and Kansas are Republican safe states In one of these states a Republican candidate can do pretty much anything and still be elected These places are where the Republican s base reside If you look at the results of previous elections in the district where this election took place a Republican candidate has won every time for the past 20 years So this election was bound to go this way no matter what We cannot expect districts like this to elect a Democrat That being said this was the narrowest victory for a Republican in the last 20 years Greg Gianforte won with just 50 2 of the vote For comparison when Obama was first elected and the Democrats won 365 seats 64 of this district voted for the Republican candidate https en m wikip,liberal

I Fixed It James Comey Donald Trump better hope that there are no tapes of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press ,liberal
This is both good and bad for the GOP One the one hand this means they can deflect the issue If they follow the Clinton Obama model they will have a special person to manage press questions about the investigation who keeps tabs on the Special Counsel so that Spicer Conway aren t being hounded by the press about it all the time Legislators might be able to rape the American people without having to deal with literally daily shit shows from the White House now On the other hand indictments depositions leaks and scared staffers will impede the administration from pushing their agenda That s obviously a victory for us as the resistance Congress might find that without leadership from the administration it s difficult to get a bill through both the House and Senate 1 isn t all bad though There s a lot of routine stuff that even a GOP congress does like hearings on North Korea or protecting old people from fraud that we want to happen without the Russia investigation getting in the way Hope,liberal
