I guess that makes sense They see all the fucked up shit that goes on in bathrooms So they feel like they need to police it All the rest of us are like Pretty sure people just use the bathroom to pee or poop ,liberal

Larry Craig will forever be the face of GOP sexual hypocrisy Way to go Idaho ,liberal
Well to be fair Trans awareness is very recent but perversion in GOP politicians is long documented PS its a public restroom Thats just gross get a room for your male prostitutes ,liberal
Considering just the sheer number on how many trans people there are this is basically impossible Unless trans people have extremely below average numbers on sexual misconduct which I kinda doubt ,liberal
I have had a few conversations with Conservative people about the bathroom issue I always compare it to speeding in a red car being illegal It is illegal to speed Passing a unique law to make speeding in a specific color of car is pointless It is illegal to harass someone in a public bathroom regardless of the size shape or orientation of your genitalia ,liberal
Seems like it would be a wise decision to ban all registered Republicans from public bathrooms ,liberal
Yep and dont even get me started on priests and other church leaders ,liberal
This article is over a year old I wonder how the numbers have changed because from my memory I m pretty sure the GOP score is up in the numbers since then ,liberal
Not a liberal here but this made it to the front and I d like to point something out The sexual misconduct isn t supposed to be targeting trans people It is a target for mainly men who would abuse the law to target women sexually in bathrooms Just like in the south there are laws that prohibit gatherings and protests where people are covering their faces This isn t a target against muslims it is a target against the KKK There 100 are people who believe that if you have a penis you should go into the bathroom with other people have penises and vice versa In the end no one is checking for dicks in the bathroom For example the comic Eddie Izzard He described himself as a lesbian trapped in a man s body I would bet that most women would feel uncomfortable if he was waiting in line for the women s restroom ,liberal
Not really related but all these guys remind me of that joke A man walks into a bar He starts a conversation with an old guy next to him The old guy has obviously had a few He says to the man You see that dock out there Built it myself it s the best dock in town But do they call me McGregor the dock builder No And you see that bridge over there I built that took me two months but do they call me McGregor the bridge builder No And you see that pier over there I built that best pier in the county But do they call me McGregor the pier builder No The old guy looks around and makes sure that nobody is listening and leans to the man and he says but you suck one dick ,liberal
Does it show blatant hypocrisy Yes Does it mean all GOP politicians are pedophiles or they at least have a general tendency to be so Absolutely not That s an important distinction we have to draw ,liberal
Its called self projection ,liberal
Well clearly they should be outlawed from using those bathrooms then ,liberal

Well the only way you can be as hateful a bitch as a gop politician is by hating the fact you hate who you are ,liberal
Just to play devil s advocate but isnt that what logical opponents to gender neutral public bathrooms argue will happen It would let pervs enter the bathroom of their choice posing as a trans person and making it harder for anyone to preemptively do anything to stop them It isn t about not letting trans people choose a bathroom it about stopping pervs from taking advantage of no one being able to complain when they follow a kid into a bathroom ,liberal

Did people forget we ve been at war for the last 15 years ,liberal
What a surprise Most people who have been indoctrinated to Fox News propaganda for the last 20 years have this same lack of awareness about the world ,liberal
Trump s profound ignorance of history and his lack of understanding the world was readily apparent prior to this statement If anyone was delusional enough to think that a new or renewed war wasn t a Republican priority would also have a profound ignorance of history Republicans are elected to start wars against brown skinned nations and discriminate against the brown skinned citizens back home This is what Republicans do and why people vote for Republicans Are people still in denial about this ,liberal
Not to mention lethal He s going to start a war to justify increased spending and when lots of people die he ll have the evidence to increase it more No politician should even be allowed to talk about war unless they ve been there themselves A caveman with nuke codes unbelievable ,liberal

So ignore Syria ISIS Turkey North Korea Russia etc and let them just rule the rest of the world How does a positive approach to conflict or hell all he said was start winning so making smarter choices about conflicts show a ignorance of history and no understanding of the world The article just brushes that aside to attack Trump via ad hominem ,liberal
Ok everyone in here seems to be an expert in geopolitics Amazing Tell me when was the last time the US won a war Frankly aside from Iraq in 1992 I don t think we ve decisively won anything since WW2 What s so important about winning Because when we lose it shows we are weak and reveals our weaknesses and we still have large enemies out there Russia China that get bolder and bolder every time we show weakness ,liberal

1 we ve been in a war for 15 years in the Middle East 2 Wartime nostalgia isn t the same as lack of knowledge of history I think wartime nostalgia is worse than ignorance because it romanticizes victory and the suffering of innocent people for the sake of economic gain The root of the problem with the whole GOP is their fixation on winning and being right They view life as a zero sum game where in order to win others have to lose In order for you to be right see religion trustworthiness of news someone else has to be wrong There is no room for relativism or compromise meaning when it comes down to it the party leaders will either realize the mistakes they have made or turn on each other to assume the last vestiges of power they can before progressivism wins out When I deal with people in my life who subscribe to this kind of winner loser mentality I like to engage them from a personal standpoint because their moral logical basis is completely broken You need to get them to buy into the,liberal

The quote which isn t directly cited to a primary source say that it s Trump s thoughts to the people who went along with him on the Obama birth certificate thing Someone didn t say that Kushner said that Trump recently said that the people right now who support him are dumb ,liberal
The article talks about Ms Spiers the NYT editor alleging that Kushner said that Trump doesn t really believe the Obama Birther Conspiracy And that Kushner said that Trump thinks that Republicans are stupid for believing it when Trump doesn t truly believe it himself So whether the allegation is true or false the whole story is based on Kushner s recounting of Trump s words of Republicans intelligence to the Obama Birther conspiracy HOW ABOUT MENTIONING IT IN THE ACTUAL TITLE How are people who only read headlines supposed to gather whether the article is talking about Trump s thoughts on his base from this week or from the 1990 s The whole story revolves around the Obama Birther conspiracy whose first reaction is to assume that Trump is talking about his base in relation to the Birther conspiracy I want to give this sub a chance but this seems disingenuous at best ,liberal

Supply side economics is a joke and they let this clown bankrupt his state to prove it AGAIN If you gear all your policy towards tax cuts for the wealthy and deregulation you will make the rich richer at the expense of everyone else including the overall economy Republican voters have been eating this garbage since the 80s and still dont seem to get that this fucks them over more than anyone Its the economic policy version of thank you sir may I have another ,liberal

Republican who has to agree not sure why poor republicans vote for this stuff ,liberal
To be fair though supply side economics has become a catch all for any tax cuts but the original economic theory that coined the term was a more specific set of policies that included cuts to government spending I don t think many reasonable economists would advocate cutting taxes in order to maintain current spending levels ,liberal
Its a truly disappointing trend in the modern national discourse ,liberal
Because one day they ll be rich and hate taxes and regulation just like their idols ,liberal
Reasonable Republicans have a huge role is saving this country right now Wish more of them would be vocal Thanks for your comment ,liberal
Here it is in a nutshell The poor vote against their interests because they re conditioned that with hard work they ll succeed in the American Dream i e at some point they ll rise up out of poverty and climb the social economic ladder When that happens they want to be insulated from the Great Unwashed which is why they vote for those that support policies against the poor The irony somehow goes unnoticed Even more importantly is that the system is structured to ensure the poor don t climb the social economic ladder These people end up being part of the reason for their own poverty While I d like to think this mentality isn t partisan poverty stricken Democrats seem to understand that Democrat policies tend to help a wider swath of the population than Republican policies this isn t universal a lot of Democrat policies still work the balls and shaft of the rich certainly ,liberal
Modern GOP does not seem to consider reasonable economic theory Their primary agenda revolves around capital gains cuts Their healthcare bill budget cuts to government aid programs etc is all purely built to balance out the capital gains tax break they want to enact which almost exclusively benefits the top brackets I would venture to bet that the vast majority of typical republican voters dont pay a dime in CG taxes outside of maybe their employer provided retirement packages which may be tax exempt in that regard anyway Id have to look that up Yes supply side economics has become a watered down term but Brownback s experiment did fail miserably and it was as close to a supply side purity test as weve had on the state level in awhile ,liberal
There are no reasonable republicans Sorry Reasonable people don t keep voting for the crap that is being put out there by Republicans ,liberal
If people were reasonable they wouldn t be Republicans ,liberal
You also leave out that people s prejudices frequently override even their own common sense Racist republicans will vote for Trump and other Repubs for the express reason that they Trump cough out the correct dog whistle terms that let them know their particular racism will be respected It seem irrelevant what other things the Republicans do to directly reduce their quality of life ,liberal
I think that s a bit too uncharitable It s worth separating the legitimate theory that s more conservative in ideology and the more extreme version that has been gaining steam in the party lately I disagree with their emphasis on capital gains and corporate taxation at the moment but I don t think it s unreasonable to look for ways to a spur investment and b lift some of the high burden of taxation off of small businesses I don t think it should necessarily be seen as an either or between supply and demand side theory ,liberal

Your statement requires facts that prove that lift some of the high burden of taxation off of small businesses actually improves small business generates new business etc Where has trickle down ever worked Oh and what exactly do you mean by small business The Republican definition Or the real definition ,liberal
Part of the issue that happened in Kansas is a whole bunch of rich people went out and got themselves labeled as LLC companies with a single employee redirecting all of their income through this new LLC so that it becomes tax exempt There ended up being nearly triple the number of income tax exempt businesses as they thought there would be when the policy went into effect in 2012 These are people with no employees and have no intent on ever hiring one and that extra money goes straight into their investment portfolio That money will probably never re enter the Kansas economy I want to support small businesses I do every chance I can by shopping with them But there needs to be better rules and definitions so that something like this can t happen again ,liberal
I m glad these ambassadors of reasonable conservatism have chosen not to stand for actively dismantling our democracy instead taking no stance at all on the matter Let s be realistic the recent elections were effectively a choice between shoot all puppies and we ll try to make an effort to feed puppies but no promises and those people voted for none of the above Yeah option 2 isn t perfect Maybe write in for an option you really think is better but come on you can at least find something to vote for there instead of refusing to take a stance and grumbling about how maybe the shoot all the puppies party isn t representing you properly ,liberal
That s fine He s not he just hides his far right wing views better ,liberal
It s a fair question and I don t think there s a simple answer Here s one source that puts the average effective rate that small businesses pay at 19 8 https www thebalance com how much tax do small businesses pay 3974568 They don t define what they mean by small business and I don t have a concrete definition off the top of my head any line we drew would be somewhat arbitrary That number is smaller than I thought it would be and I guess that a large percentage of small business owners only pay through income tax but my main goal would be leveling the playing field between large corporations and small business a bit Democrats used to be much better about fighting for competition as a core economic principle I m for a more progressive corporate taxation policy not to penalize large businesses but in the interest of giving small business more leverage to hire and grow Correct me if I m wrong but I think that the effective business corporate tax rates often tend to go down as the size of ,liberal

Keep in mind that this is all based on Session s own words FRANKEN These documents also allegedly say there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government Again I m telling you this as it s coming out so you know But if it s true it s obviously extremely serious and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign what will you do SESSIONS Senator Franken I m not aware of any of those activities I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians and I m unable to comment on it Franken didn t ask if anyone affiliated with the campaign communicated with the Russians about campaign business which is what the Republican establishment is now trying to defend against He asked is anyone affiliated with the campaign communicated with the Russians durin,liberal

I can t believe I have to explain this further to you The point of what I said is that he can t say it s wrong to have a ban on these countries that is meant to protect our country while also taking pride in the fact that he went to their lands and killed their people which didn t protect and serve us If you miss the disconnect in logic there then that is on you not me I can t force you to understand it On the topic of joining the military in general you are making way too many assumptions People don t just join to protect and serve our country Many and I would argue MOST people joining the military don t do so to protect and serve our country they do it because they have no other prospects or skills they want a place to fit in or they just think it is cool Some do join because they think they are doing good but that is not the majority reason If someone joined because they got brainwashed into thinking they were somehow defending our country I don t hold that against them Read that ag,liberal

In all honesty all of those examples that come after America sound like clever dog whistles Racial identity both to address the incident but also targeting non whites when they bring up inequality Class identity gender sexuality etc multiculturalism too these are all dog whistles to the accusation of identity politics which by and large is just conservatives getting angry that non white non cis hetero poorer or middle income Americans all want equality It s not X first it s America first only works out if X isn t a part of America to begin with ,liberal

The main point of Federalist 46 is that the states can resist the federal gov t because they are closer to the people Likewise the legislature being made up of people responsible to their states can largely protect the states from an overreaching federal gov t He argued that combined state militias could overcome the federal armed forces which today would be the national guard though in today s world we know that is no longer true This highlights the irrelevance of Madison s argument in today s America ,liberal

America has never seen an electorate that cared less either Almost every major policy flaw or display of incompetence is forgotten within weeks Republican policy contradicts almost all non partisan research but they align fairly well with informal American culture We call business owners job creators for Christ s sake like they re doing you a favor As long as conventional American culture remains the selfish and divided sewer of dishonesty it is then the Republican party will never go away or change Let s reflect on the fact that we consistently have multimillionaires call college educated 20 year olds elites with a straight face ,liberal
They are absolutely hostile I can t imagine why they hate working folks so much ,liberal

Nope no facts again nothing here but conjecture and opinion pieces One link you posted even bragged about how powerful of a weapon it would be if liberals invested the time an effort in making the case that Conversatives are modern day Confederates but nobody anyone respects actually does that except those on the fringe which is made up of the crazy anonymous website educated losers like you ,liberal
Did we say racist We said confederate You heard racist because you re projecting Racism was not necessarily a defining characteristic of the confederacy but it was a major tool and it certainly wasn t seen as a negative factor in their leadership No the defining factor is nationalism and with the heavy ties between national identity and racial identity the terms racist and nationalist have been largely interchangeable but it s the nationalism that the majorly toxic one Racism obviously seems unpalatable in this day and age as it was more than a hundred years ago It s not nice to be called a racist but a race realist seems more likable If only in your head ,liberal
It s amazing how you said so little in so many words The ideals carry from the confederacy have carried over to modern day republicans You aren t even denying or disproving that with what you said And then that race shit at the end no one said anything about racism at all so your post probably would have come off a little less scatter brained if you hadn t thrown that in there ,liberal
I knew your sorry goper ass would try and continue to rationalize your bullshit Typical lying Republiscum ,liberal
Again you make a statement but provide no facts to back up anything I even did you the courtesy of bringing up the controversial issues today which are commonly used to support the notion that Republicans are racist but you somehow inferred expanding on detail as scatter brained I think you are terrified to have a discussion because you know you can t back up you initial inflammatory claim with factual evidence or examples Is the weed wearing off I ll give you some time to pack up the bong ,liberal
Don t blame me because you posted some stupid fucking links to garbage opinions you tried to pass off as fact Little advice before the next time you try making yourself look like a fucking retard try reading the bullshit you reference before posting it it will go a long way in making you think twice before using it to defend your position Good luck with the pointless protesting ,liberal
You haven t backed up anything you ve said and that s key since most of what you ve said has been bullshit I m not terrified of anything you people are just impossible to have any kind of discussion with because as soon as the discussion starts this is what happens You re coming right at my throat in like three different parts of that reply Hostile You re the problem ,liberal
Actually it s up to you to backup your assertions I m not under any obligations to prove anything because I m not the one declaring America has never seen a less caring party You want to play a victim now I m pretty sure you got all ass hurt because I attacked your weak ass arguments you tried to back up with bullshit links then you started lobbing insults at me because you didn t follow the direction of my argument I think this epitomizes the problem with you people you start off all confident until your argument disintegrates before your eyes and then you curl up in a ball and act like your a victim ,liberal

IIRC the Obama administration justified things like the Dreamers program and ignoring state based marijuana legalization by citing limited resources Basically I know Im supposed to deport all illegal aliems but realistically I dont have the resources to do that so Im going to prioritize violent criminals And I know federal law states that marijuana is illegal everywhere but Im ordering the DEA to focus its resources on states that havent voted to legalize it Youd have to ask an actual lawyer but to me there seems to be a difference between letting some things slide because I have limited resources and killing funding for this law I dont like ,liberal

Not true at all unless you mean 4 out of 6 of the First order comments not replies are conservative talking points being spewed out by conservatives lol I think if you go try to rationally debate a point on r conservative or r republican like I have you ll find yourself being quickly banned there for daring to not tow the party line The fact that this subreddit has trolls proves the same is not true here ,liberal
except r conservatives will ban you for simply saying commenting something that doesn t settle well with them edit ,liberal
His argument ,liberal
His ridiculous rhetoric was obliterated and no one cares about swaying his mindless supporters You can t reason with them they know Republican rhetoric is utter bullshit they re just complicit Instead we want to open the eyes of non political voters who don t vote across party lines in the hopes of taking those key votes away from such a dangerous and twisted piece of shit ,liberal

I don t get it They can put you on a watch list without you having done anything wrong Then they can take away rights because of suspicion alone That strikes me as guilty until proven innocent ,liberal

I m not scared of terrorists or guns I m scared of watchlists ,liberal
Just a reminder You cannot take away someone s Constitutional rights just at the whim of some bureaucrat This violates not only the 2nd Amendment but the Due process clause as well It is a violation of the Constitution to prevent someone from their rights without due process of finding them guilty of something Being under suspicion has no burden of proof the accused has no ability to face his accuser and is just arbitrary Should we arrest and jail immediately anyone who has been accused of rape without charging them Is it okay to deprive someone of their rights just because there were some bad things said about them or someone thought they were suspicious ,liberal
I got a knock and talk from the FBI about 5 years ago for basically saying that I would incite rioting This was right after the Gabby Gifford shooting and someone on FB was basically making threats to Obama I said if he was killed there should be rioting Someone took that as a threat you would think it would have been the person making threats against the President but what ever THREE agents came to my door to talk to me I m a middle aged white woman with a Bachelors in Social Work and I have worked for the Government I still say some inflammatory things on the internet but I also watch what I say after the incident Does that mean I am on a watch group Maybe Does that mean I shouldn t be able to own a gun with out the benefit of a trial by a Judge or Jury of my peers I personally don t think so Every person should have their day in court before their ability to own a gun is taken away If the FBI thinks they are that much of a threat take them to court over it Republicans are right on t,liberal

Going through the comments completely changed my position on this This is why I love reddit ,liberal
Because it d be terrible for the government to be able to do so ,liberal
Just a reminder independent of issues of gun control ownership the terror watch list hasn t prevented a single incident of terror despite constantly being paraded as a justification for violating your basic human rights Don t let these 50 unfortunate lives lost be another empty excuse to screw over your fellow human beings that much more And fuck you Politifact You could have cited plenty of statements about gun control without buying into this anti humanitarian watch list bullshit ,liberal

Greetings from r Libertarian I m pleasantly surprised with this thread Respect 1 ,liberal
I think there has to be some middle ground here Some people say if a person is on the watch list they should not be allowed to buy guns Some people say that people on a watch list should be allowed to buy a gun so long as they have not been found guilty of a crime How about we compromise Let s say that if a person on the watch list buys a gun or guns or ammunition it is reported to the watchers so they can keep an eye on the person Maybe a little talk with the FBI could stop a crime Or maybe a person is denied the chance to buy a gun today but has the right to appeal If the appeal goes through then they can buy a gun tomorrow Rights are not absolute people We also have a Constitutional right to drink alcohol but the government can tell us who can buy it and how much we can consume and when we can consume it Very few people bitch about the government controlling our alcohol consumption ,liberal

It is This is an area where republicans actaully are right I don t say that about many topics when it comes to republicans ,liberal
As undemocratic and unconstitutional as it gets but spend enough time on this board and you ll realize that democrats love to take away rights just as much as republicans if it fits their agenda to do so ,liberal

I am kind of curious how a state that votes in a person of this low intelligence could still keep running itself You know infrastructure and various departments like education taxing policing judicial How could it even keep running i find it very difficult to believe that most of the citizens of Alabama are idiots But the GOP want us to believe that so I don t really believe that this guy was actually legitimately voted in and it s starting to look like most of the GOP was never legitimately voted in It s really starting to look like our whole election process is totally corrupt ,liberal
Friendly neighborhood Alabama liberal here Seeing a lot of talk along the lines of sentient cow turds cobbled together by errant kudzu vines are the only kinds of people who could vote for this particular steaming pile of excrement and though it is fun thought to think that the Yellowhammer State is compiled of invasive vine species homunculi I think that isn t an entirely fair assessment I think perhaps it s easier to think that than to consider generations of educational inequity poor state leadership and the almost universal belief that what we do here doesn t matter because of Jebus and his swinging chariot My state is a shithole but it didn t get here on its own Some of us are trying to change it but we re up against things a lot greater than the Cousin Brother stereotype gleefully shouting But Obama Give Alabama is justly deserved shellacking but maybe try to understand some of the historical and perverse cultural themes that got it here today ,liberal

This is why religion and politics should never be mixed Some religious believe that if your good you won t get sick if something happens to you you are being punished because of your bad behavior That causes them to look down on and refuse to help others because they see themselves as superior It also causes major issues when something happens my mother had a breakdown when she miscarried her second child She is SUPER religious so to her everything that happens in someone s life is a direct consequence of their faith It s scary ,liberal
but the thing is there s lots of states that have these totally and completely unqualified congress persons and governors and we even have a president like this right now And he is putting completely bizarre and incompetent people with negative agendas into positions of power there s just too many of them for us to have been voting them in It s not logical it doesn t make sense they didn t get elected Something s up behind the scenes interfering with our election process ,liberal

This is one of the best comments I ve read on Reddit lately Humorous colorful witty and explanatory Bravo I honestly don t know what to think or do about states and counties that will vote R no matter how wrongheaded the person attached to the letter is or places that vote on a pro life basis only without any regard for other policy dimensions Most of me prefers that these states didn t exist or didn t influence national policy As weird intolerant as it sounds we have nooks and corners of the country that by themselves make insane national policy possible and if they were excised we could have a country more similar to Canada but with roughly 8x the population bigger cities warmer climate and an economy nearly identical to the present US Basically we have places like AL KY MS LA etc that have aided and abetted the poisoning of the supreme court with far right wing justices and given us gems like Jefferson Beauregard Sessions as AG and Mitch McConnell as SOB hypocrite extraordinaire I d,liberal

Until we determine whether or not the Trump administration won their positions through illegal means they should not be putting anyone on the scotus ,liberal
This is not a big deal He is a member of the appeals court so it makes sense both that the Supreme Court might review a case he ruled on and that they might overturn his decision That it happens during his confirmation hearing is coincidence Like you can dislike the guy for being conservative and there are very good reasons to not want him on the Supreme Court This is not one of them ,liberal
This is what happens when you have Donald Trump using Antonin Scalia as a blueprint A guy who thought that black people belong in slower track schools Trump used a stupid person as a blueprint so of course the result is going to be a stupid person ,liberal
Whoops ,liberal
the guy is a complete psychopath like all conservative judges will destroy the country for decades ,liberal
Trump s pick of Gorsuch is highly suspicious to me Why would this radical for all intents and purposes choose such a moderate to be in the supreme court It didn t bring his popularity up any it didn t boost his image so to speak It all seems very fishy ,liberal
Wall oh yeah I forgot all you children think the point of the Supreme Court is to have nine puppets up there agreeing with you Yes I m sure Gorsuch is the first person to ever give an opinion other members of the court might disagree with Good God 2018 will be a slaughter with you people Are you completely unaware of the purpose of the Supreme Court Do you actually in your strange little world think that the other Supreme Court justices will find it unusual that they disagreed with a colleague Good God ,liberal
deleted ,liberal
I have always figured that the whole Russian and other legal troubles will eventually come back to bite Trump but I don t have a lot of hope that this government will actually do anything about it But I think after four years of this hell most people will come to their sense including republicans who no longer have to be fearful of losing votes and just take steps to de legitimize Trumps presidency and that includes removing any of his SCOTUS picks ,liberal
Yeah the timing is coincidence That s it 8 0 Not even the die hard Conservative judges remotely agreed with his judgment I think making poor judgment calls is a good reason not to want a judge on the Supreme court ,liberal
You re missing the point This can obviously happen and wouldn t be a big deal in most cases The point the article is making is that the decisions he made were awful The article is pointing out how this guy is not able to make good decisions and the current supreme court justices are basically agreeing with that by overturning his decision ,liberal
You can say a lot about Justice Scalia but he was not a stupid man by any stretch ,liberal
Scalia was a clear bigot with an agenda but he was an absolutely brilliant jurist Liberal and conservative lawyers all agree that he was a genius legal mind ,liberal
That s not what Scalia said Jesus That s a terrible accusation to make ,liberal
When they unanimously disagree with your assessment it begs the question as to whether your judgement is valuable at all ,liberal
You would actually be able to convey a reasonable point if you didn t speak with all of the wit of a child and pepper your post with so much nonsense 2018 will be a slaughter for us people because some on the left hold an irrational view of the qualifications of a SCOTUS nominee Right like no one on the right has EVER done that You people should be worried about 2018 because the president you people put into office is increasingly looking like the most incompetent and crooked POTUS in the history of the country And he hasn t even been in office for 100 days ,liberal

I also feel that every Congress person that voted for the Iraq war should leave government When people make a bad call it should be over for them ,liberal
Not only that Gorsuch s judgement was that schools have no obligation to provide services for students with special needs beyond de minimis meaning just shy of nothing ,liberal
My understanding is Gorsuch followed the law as it was written and was in the majority of other circuits on this same issue A minority of circuits had the opposite holding The Supreme Court took the position of the minority of the appeals courts ,liberal
it s bullshit how california is silenced 3rd largest economy in the world but votes in the midwest count for more per capita ,liberal
One out of eight Americans is Californian So 1 8th of Americans get 2 Senators and the other 7 8ths get 98 Senators Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein represent forty million people Next time a senator from some lightly populated backwater who represents less than a tenth as many people tells Kamala Harris to shut up she should put him in his place ,liberal

the house is a thing ,liberal
Itt people who don t understand the difference between the House and Senate This is probably why we keep losing ,liberal
By 2040 I hope to have enough money that I can buy my own Senator Seriously though we have to look at it from the other side Most of the members of the House of Representatives will be from the 15 states ,liberal
This is actually correct by design the Senate is supposed to represent the States regardless of population so both California and Texas have the same clout as say Rhode Island or Wyoming The House on the other hand represents the People and accordingly 15 states will have the majority of Representatives with sparsely populated states might end up with only 1 Representative In the House California Texas NY Florida have a higher clout than Rhode Island Wyoming etc ,liberal
As an outsider may I suggest a compromise Go for proportion of population for passing federal laws i e the vote of a Senator from California is proportional to his her population which would mean it s effectively stronger State laws stay as they are as does the Supreme Court However when it comes to constitutional change that must be passed as is i e iirc proposed by a 2 3 majority in both the Senate and House at one vote per Senator Rep and then ratified by 3 4 of the state legislatures at one vote per legislature member ,liberal
Prevents a tyranny of the majority This wouldn t be a big deal if Californians wernt trying to oppress the rest of the country ,liberal
It s actually the 6th largest in the world https en wikipedia org wiki Economy_of_California not the 3rd It s still big but it s not 3 ,liberal
Not bullshit brilliant design by the founders The bicameral system takes into account the equality of the states and their varying population sizes The arguments are no different now than they were 200 odd years ago ,liberal

Add up Wyoming Alaska Montana Dakotas Idaho West Virginia and Nebraska and you get a population of 9 4 million people Those 9 4 million people get 16 Senators while California s population of 39 million gets 2 Senators 3 of the population gets 16 of the Senate And 12 of the population gets 2 ,liberal
Exactly why do we need another totally unrepresentative body making decisions ,liberal
Its also heavily gerrymandered ,liberal
Pretty pathetic The only thing I can say is that there shouldn t be a cap on how many members of the House there is It should grow with population But you re right I guess our political faction forgot what the House is here for Someone above said that Wyoming has 6600 more power in the senate than California This is true from a certain point of view but it is not a valid argument The whole reason the senate was established in the first place was to prevent larger more populous states from dictating what occurs in smaller states which have less say in the House ,liberal
We understand we just think it s a stupid idea ,liberal
but tell us is the Judicial branch a part of government ,liberal
I hate the tyranny by majority argument It assumes that the people should not be allowed to tell their government what to do and we need benevolent oligarchs to make our decisions for us If the majority doesn t rule who does An oligarchy with few checks and balances that s what ,liberal
Except this principle went by the wayside when the house was capped at 435 members Because the apportionmemt of Representatives now can not track to the populations of the states California gets 53 reps while Wyoming the least populous state gets 1 but California has a population approximately 68 times that of Wyoming California has been cheated of 15 Representatives This disparity gets worse when adding in the two more seats every state gets in the Electoral College ,liberal
Don t let the populous North abolish slavery ,liberal
Besides we ve always done it that way what is a good argument for this I sometimes hear people claim that it ensures rural populations and certain regions aren t ignored But there s no definitive rural urban split between big and small states nor obvious regional or cultural split There are a lot of rural Texans Rhode Island is nearly all urban the East South Midwest and West each have at least one big state and one little state and the culture of the county is more integrated today because of transportation and media We also don t have enough congresspeople per capita Representatives are less accessible and districts are too big More reps would reduce the the value of their vote and makes it more expensive for special interests to buy them with campaign funding More reps deepens the talent pool for committee assignments and even if districts were half as large as they are now they would be large enough to have plenty of qualified people in them A bigger house might have more independe,liberal
It s not brilliant at all Who the fuck cares about what states think People are what matter We don t need to be ruled by a minority of small population states simply because of historical inertia It s even worse and dumber than rule by the majority or rule by the rich or rule by aristocracy State borders are utterly arbitrary and hold no significant meaning in 2017 Americans aren t tied to state identity anymore Ideology matters more Occupation matters more Cities matter more Social class matters more Your state residence is utterly meaningless and a bad correlator to more meaningful identity ,liberal
Not bullshit brilliant design by the founders You misspelled idiotic ,liberal
Not really that brilliant imo ,liberal
I would honestly be more sympathetic to that line of reasoning if it were any other president But it s hard to care when respect for the president and not questioning his legitimacy only seems to matter since January 20 2017 Before then it was open season on whether the president was a citizen or whether his wife was even human or just an ape in heels So no Trump I don t care about your feelz ,liberal
Sorry we thought you were single handedly ushering in a culture free from political correctness So when you insult someone and then praise them the next day we re going to call you a fraud When you tell us to do one thing and then you do another we ll call you a hypocrite And when you tell a whopper of a lie we re not going to refer to it as an alternate fact You ve made your bed President Snowflake Now go ahead and lay in it ,liberal

Pretty sure the GOP spent the last years trying to demoralize Obama Boo fucking hoo Republicans What comes around goes around but this time it s for real ,liberal
He only won because of a technicality and it s eating him up A whole lot more people voted for the other candidate This was a popularity contest to him and he lost It s like he was playing a game of 8 ball getting his ass handed to him and as his opponent had cleared the table and was about to shoot the 8 ball in a drunken Russian guy bumped into her and made her scratch thus causing her to lose the game Sure Trump gets the win in the books but not because he knocked more balls in but because of an arbitrary rule that bit the obviously better player in the ass ,liberal

Good Fuck him If you came out to any protest last weekend keep going Today was awful in terms of executive orders there s plenty to protest fucking stay active ,liberal
My biggest fear is that he ll get so freaked out and stressed that his fried food loving heart will break and we ll end up with Mike Pence The positive however is the fact that he flipped his lid http www rawstory com 2017 01 white house sources say trump was visibly enraged at the size of the womens march report about the women s march this weekend It gives me faith that we can very easily mess with his head ,liberal
It s a little late for sympathy at this point but if he wants to start making steps in the right direction then he should start doing things for ALL people not just himself his supporters and his billionaire pals Stop taking peoples rights away without first listening to the demands of the people He s not even trying to unite our country like a real president would ,liberal
Really REALLY He s demoralized on fucking day 3 What a goddamn joke It infuriates me how the republicans strut around thumping their chests and acting like tough guys but at the first sign of criticism or resistance they fucking MELT ,liberal
Good ,liberal
As he should be ,liberal
I don t give a fuck how he feels He s a shitwad that is already ruining this country ,liberal
With how he is acting as president already I ve no sympathy ,liberal
Such a delicate snowflake ,liberal
He could totally help himself if he cut out the voter fraud shit He continues to perpetuate this conspiracy theory that delegitimize it s him ,liberal
He was already miserable Anyone with that poor an outlook on life and complete disdain for the facts is not in good mental health ,liberal
Then start being a real fucking President Problem solved ,liberal
Donald Trump has surrounded himself with people who share hard line policies that will prove ruinous Hang onto your hats folks we re in for a rough ride ,liberal
For a career bully this guy is such a pussy ,liberal

Everyone is being hypocritical and its fuelling partisanship and violence We are allready down the dark path my friends ,liberal
To be fair they never rioted and destroyed property because of it ,liberal
There is so much hypocrisy on both sides Remember everyone saying Obama was gonna take their guns and lock them up in fema camps Some liberals think Trump is gonna deport all the brown people and allow mobs to kill gays and blacks ,liberal
I do I also find it pretty fucking ironic that we were concerned that Trump supporters were going to riot and try to overturn things and now our side is doing exactly that ,liberal
Yeah but I also find it ironic that people who were outraged at Trump implying he wouldn t accept the election results are currently doing everything in their power to change the election results I m not even a Trump supporter and I would be genuinely angry if electors did ignore the votes of their states like that change org petition is calling for Ignoring an individual state s votes to get the result you want is NOT OKAY ,liberal
What was Trump s reason for saying that ,liberal
It s not ironic it s hypocritical on both sides Try to avoid that liberals it does no good ,liberal

They also said they wouldn t accept the results of the election if Hillary won so they would have continued their non acceptance of the President to 12 years ,liberal
Conservatives tell everyone to leave They want Obama to go back to his home country if Hawaii ,liberal
Man of personal ideals here I lean right but I ve never heard a single person say that about Obama Also they didn t riot Still I have a bit of a bias here to be honest I m no friend of Obama s ,liberal
I don t recall any top republicans or a large enough group of the population actually doing this though Well not anybody I ve seen anyway But if you have any examples of this I would be interested ,liberal
Like their god emperor most of their insults are complete projections of their own traits ,liberal
What else are they hypocrites on Just going over it in my head they have pretty consistent views ,liberal
Donal Trump called for revolution more than once in 2012 when he mistakenly thought Obama lost the popular vote and won the electoral vote ,liberal
People had a lot more to lose from Trump winning than from Obama winning Trump voters wanted chaos and now they have it The rioting is violent it s wrong it s destructive and it was the easiest thing anyone could have predicted would happen from a Trump win ,liberal
There s a very damaged wildlife sanctuary in Oregon that begs to differ ,liberal

To be fair Obama did praise the Australian gun buy back as did hillary Trump has said he supports no fly no buy which conservatives libertarians should be scrutinizing him for ,liberal
I think you re letting whatever bias you have cloud your judgement While CNN is a private entity and reserves the right to investigate into a person who garnered national attention what they DID do is not right They could ve have either respected his wish to remain private or just went through with the article with his identity intact However what they did do is proffer a veiled threat in which CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change How can you tell me that doesn t read like blackmail Let s be intellectually honest here Trump and CNN are destroying their own credibility with these childish antics ,liberal
I m shocked at how much traction this story has gotten This has to be the biggest pile of who fucking cares nonsense to come out of this presidency yet And that s an impressive accomplishment when all things are considered ,liberal
Here s the thing though It was a fucking meme A funny one too The creators of memes are irrelevant to whether or not the memes themselves are hilarious He wasn t posting his info graphic of Jews on trumps timeline and trump didn t retweet those It was a harmless meme and who the fuck looks into the creator of a meme before they share it anyway ,liberal

Anyone defending CNN in this has no business calling themselves a liberal You are defending a powerful corporation bullying a private citizen into silence for the crime of saying things you don t like It doesn t matter how shitty this guy was This is still a corporation threatening someone to make them do what that corporation wants It is no different from a big kid on a playground threatening a smaller kid for his lunch money And you re all fine with it because the smaller kid is a douche The ideal of free speech doesn t exist to protect popular majority viewpoints It exists to protect minority viewpoints even when those viewpoints are morally abhorrent When we start making exceptions and deciding certain ideas and opinions should not be protected the restrictions and exceptions we put in place can and WILL be used and abused against anyone they can be applied to Approving of the silencing of one minority viewpoint paves the way for silencing all minority viewpoints And yes I know CNN,liberal

CNN shouldn t have even involved the OP and they certainly shouldn t have threatened him It s a story because Trump tweeted it not because the guy made it If CNN has a problem with Trump they should take it up with Trump They couldn t have handled this situation any worse than they did The optics would have been much better if they had just reported his name or not reported his name They need to get there shit together ,liberal
We shouldn t be doubling down on unethical journalism this only helps confirm misunderstandings toward liberalism At this point this post is just toeing the party line ,liberal
Do you think it was right for CNN to get so butthurt over a funny meme Let s be honest even if this is legal CNN got so triggered over a meme that they decided to track down and contact the creator and force him to apologize and stop trolling he admitted he was only trolling in the apology or else they would release his personal information That is a terrible move regardless of legality ,liberal
Check account You posted this dozens of times to dozens of subreddits How much is CNN paying you and how can I get your job ,liberal
CNN should have released his name I don t agree with the method they took It was a valid story because it s Trump retweeting it and the guys history as a trump supporter that has been spewing racism on the internet knowing what he was doing This guy is a part of a culture that uses the internet anonymity to say that stuff they won t say in public because they know it s wrong and can impact their life ,liberal

Defending fascism Think like us or be punished ,liberal
So because he said some racist stuff his right to privacy is out the window Let s put a bug in everyone s bedroom and exploit their privacy if they don t embrace all other races before their own Pretty soon only one opinion may be voiced ,liberal
They didn t release his name though They threatened to release his name if he didn t act according to THEIR standards If they released it then they could claim it was somehow fucking news but no they chose to be incredibly butthurt about a goddamn meme ,liberal
I don t support any of this because it doesn t matter what this guy is posting on an online forum What matters is CNN couldn t take down TRUMP when he posted a meme so they went after the person who supposedly made it and decided hey this guy who didn t do anything to us and shitposts on reddit says stuff we don t like so let s go after him That s a huge problem ,liberal

Notice how Liberals constantly constantly speak about the merits and flaws of investigations and whatnot against Liberals but conservatives always buckle down and put fingers in ears when their dudes get targeted by anything Another gay sex scandal Not in MY GOP ,liberal
I lurk in r conservative since I was banned for disagreeing with how Trump treated the white house correspondents Im honestly shocked at the lack of stories about anything from yesterday Nothing about the wiretapping inveatigstion the Russian collusion investigation or even the Gorsuch hearings The mods over there must be working overtime to filter out the stories that dont fit their narrative ,liberal
Immediately the OP was accused of McCarthyism and the mods deleted the post and banned the user Sand v Head ,liberal
Of course they won t admit it Admitting it will require them to admit Trump is a liar Admitting he s a liar will mean admitting they were duped which would mean they re all fools They re never going to do that They ll go down with their burning ship screaming about how the ship is just fine That s how Conservatives work ,liberal

Who is losing it Having listened to the hearing myself I d be much more concerned if I was someone who leaked information or wrote baseless accusations in a newspaper than if I were Donald Trump ,liberal
actually i usually see a lot of good discussion there which is why its so unusual that they won t even mention this ,liberal
I m new to Reddit it is amazing by the way and I was searching for political subreddits and found it odd that r conservative has 50 000 more subscribers than this one As unusual as it is to be a liberal from Tennessee it shocked me to see more conservatives on here I thought Facebook where people like my poor racist uncle on Medicaid shares anti welfare memes was their natural habitat ,liberal

The president also suggested that because Blumenthal once exaggerated his Vietnam military service he has no credibility Right Projection again ,liberal
Trump is literally ignoring reality Gorsuch s spokesperson confirmed it Trump keeps saying it was made up ,liberal
Blumenthal joined the Marine Corps Reserves in 1970 and served six years all in the United States He has accurately described his service many times in his career but in 2008 he told an audience at an event in Norwalk We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam And you exemplify it Whatever we think about the war whatever we call it Afghanistan or Iraq we owe our military men and women unconditional support Blumenthal explained Tuesday that he meant to say he served during Vietnam not in Vietnam How does this makes him lose all credibility when Donald has lied far more egregiously ,liberal
Well maybe he won t be such a bad pick after all ,liberal
Is there something he is handling well ,liberal
I think this is all a ruse Trump might have even told him to criticize him for something so the Dems don t filibuster him Nevermind A rational person may think like that not Donny ,liberal

He s actually the most qualified of the ones Trump considered ,liberal
Considering how tiny his hands are maybe skittles in small quantities I bet he doesn t even have any ethical issues eating the orange ones ,liberal
Yep There are some cases where I can kind of understand why his supporters would take his side if it s something somewhat debatable But this is just the total rejection of reality ,liberal
Yea well maybe Obama should have done something about it besides pout about in the corner Could you imagine the outrage if a GOP president was denied a choice The Democrats had two golden chances to turn the public against them in the past 4 years This and the shutdown But they didn t do jack shit about it I will forever be soured on Obama and the rest of the Democrats for how they handled that If only Warren and Sanders put a quarter of their effort of protesting Trump to protesting Republican obstructionism But nope this country can t think a head to save their own ass ,liberal
How is it a stolen seat ,liberal

So how is this not the final nail in the coffin Now we know The Russian government performed the hacks Trump s campaign was in contact with the Russian government Wikileaks was the clearing house for all the hacked data Trump s campaign had access to Wikileaks Can we not surmise that he colluded with the Russians facilitated the hacks and then promoted them He is guilty of crimes by doing this not the least of which is the computer fraud and abuse act Just because he used foreign agents to do it doesnt change the fact that he aided abetted and facilitated a crime ,liberal

Maybe just maybe the DNC should have shoved Hillary down liberal voters throats She was uncharismatic boring bland and as exciting as a piece of cardboard Also Americans were clammering for something anti establishment an outsider a populist and what does the DNC do They give us a fucking insider a cog in the establishment and the exact opposite of a populist and make her face off against the very embodiment of a populist Trump Are you honestly surprised Also lets not forget the fact shes lost in 2008 to a populist Obama Did the DNC really think trying the same shit twice would work Like really ,liberal
Republicans still have only won the popular vote once since 1992 The irony here is the Electoral College was meant to protect against the likes of Trump ,liberal
For the second time in our lives the majority is overruled You mean plurality No candidate received 50 of the vote ,liberal
Sidenote if you abolish the college people in states that dont matter would have turned out more so this doesnt mean clinton would have won this could actually be bad for third parties as its easier to jump to third party if your in a state where you have no influence in the democrat vs republican thing ,liberal
Here s an idea make voting day a national holiday publicly fund campaigns make the election cycle shorter make sure all candidates get equal air time and ad space as well as a place on the debate stage Maybe make voting mandatory Then we don t have shit shows like this again ,liberal
Do you not realize that in places like CA there is plenty of Republicans who don t vote because they know it s of no use A lot more than there are non voting liberals in traditionally conservative states Simply because traditionally Democrat states have large cities and metropolitan areas that vote Democrat with suburbs and country that vote Republican While Republican states have both large cities and suburbs and country that vote Republican For the most part So if the election system was changed it s quite possible that Democrats would start losing more often than winning And the popular vote would reflect it But then you would be bitching about something else ,liberal
You all didn t vote in 2014 or in 2016 So fuck you not the EC ,liberal
There is plenty of sin to go around here Wasserman Schultz and the DNC come to mind ,liberal
Just something to reflect on While the popular vote would make elections more fair and true to the actual number count the electoral system introduces a diversity into the calculation that wouldn t otherwise be there Most people in the same geographic region think alike That s not to say they think good things or bad things just alike By deliberately diluting the contribution of any one area no matter how dense we can get a broader input of perspectives and avoid limiting groupthink ,liberal
Maine broke its EVs up Seems up to the states to come up with schemes to apportion EVs and maine s are not winner take all The issue I suppose is to force from the federal level the elimination of EVs which I would surmise would require a constitutional amendment 75 of the states better start the draft of the amendment ,liberal

As a Canadian I m pretty pumped about America leaving the climate accord I love America I think you all are awesome Here s the thing though more countries are joining together and getting in step when it comes to the environment Everybody is collectively starting to pull their weight to make things better If America wants to pull out that s their choice but in the very near future many companies and people will be refusing to do business with anyone that continue to pollute and treat the environment like shit As countries start to pull out of America and for new trade partners I fully believe Canada can absorb some of those new trade deals America will also attract a certain type of business ethos as companies that want to operate in a certain way will be attracted to those lack policies Most countrys can dump their shitty business majors that only want to focus on profits can migrate to America and pollute and drive profits skyhigh all they want Everyone else can work on solutions an ,liberal

Trump is an ignorant dick Yes there are provisions in the Paris accord that allow India and China to continue polluting longer than the more highly de eloped world until per capita gdp catches up with ours a bit What he s doing is saying g I want my Maypo to the whole world A body who doesn t know what Maypo is should hope there s an old ad on the Google I used to work for a guy who was like that He had a lazy Susan if bad ideas that on a given day always came to a stop at you guessed it a bad idea Then he d pout when it got shot down ,liberal

Poor naive Canadian They don t care about the environment they care about filling their coffers with more profile You think the carbon tax in Canada is gonna have any effect vs just raising costs for citizens you is naive It s gonna give Trudeau more tax payer money he can waste While corporations will pass the cost of carbon to consumers while doing nothing for the environment Why does China get a free pass to pollute in the accord ,liberal
Damn not a single reply Nobody even knows what this accord does do you ,liberal
How long do you have ,liberal
I don t think you re correct at all Maybe early on we ll see cost increases That is the point of the carbon tax making it more expensive to pollute Price of goods will go up early on it won t last though Prices go up because the tax is going to cost business more to operate if they pollute But what happens after the prices go up Business is business companies that choose to be environmentally minded will have reduced operating costs and be able to pass that along to consumers or employees either way they will be in a better place to do business than companies that decide to dig in and not change anything I find it funny people opposed to the tax feel that the price increase of goods is a jab at it because that is the purpose make it inconvenient for a business to operate if they choose to dump pollutants into the environment without any concern If a business wants to be competitive they will need to adjust how they operate We will start to see better greener businesses start to pop up ,liberal

China is currently regretting ignoring all the experts that have warned them for decades about pollution China has smog advisories think about that for a minute Their air is so polluted they have days where the weather man warns people to not go outside It is why China is finally getting on board with everybody else to make things better The environment is zero sum its not something we can keep treating like it has some infinite potential to absorb pollutants An how do you not understand part of maximizing profit is reducing your operating costs It goes hand in hand Why assume I m delusional when you can t understand that revenue cost profits You re drinking kool aid son Read learn understand instead of parroting bullshit put out by people with agendas ,liberal

Something to consider as well Think of the conservatives in Canada and Stephen Harper They swear up and down climate change is not a threat it s over blown Yet at the same time he increases the military s presence in the arctic They increase the presence in the North along with the other two countries that also deny climate change is a threat We have America Canada and Russia prepositioning and jockeying for territory in the North in anticipation of the ice thawing in order to access those resources while at the same time trying to spread the message that there s nothing worry about These politicians are full of shit they say one thing while doing another The messed up part is they make it a political issue so everyone in the party falls inline without ever considering things like why we are all of a sudden so focused on the North ,liberal

The accompanying picture is well out of date It s of the previous Yale President and the previous Secretary immediately behind him who was succeeded in 2013 Doesn t really say much for journalistic integrity if they can t even source a picture of the current administration and it makes me question whether the details of the article are accurate The idea that campus police would be called upon a journalist the insinuation being that the removal was politically motivated seems somewhat dubious considering Yale administrations strong liberal leaning In my experience Yale would only call the police to remove somebody if they felt they were harassing or threatening the students faculty or staff ,liberal

Why does a single person need a 2 bedroom Isn t a one bedroom or studio enough Edit despite single parents anyone who wants a 2 bedroom shouldnt be working a minimum wage job and expect to be able to buy luxury living accommodations A studio and one bedroom should be enough for a single person living alone ,liberal
Before I get backlash for this I am liberal and I also am a student of economics Increasing federal minimum wage is a very bad idea in the long run All it does is decrease the value of the dollar and hurt everyone including the people making minimum wage getting that increase in pay We don t need a higher minimum wage we need INSTEAD OF minimum wage single payer health systems AND government funded housing for low income individuals and families ,liberal

There s probably nothing more dispositive of who wins next year s elections than where the president stands a year before Nancy Pelosi That s not wishful thinking that s history The party in power ALWAYS loses seats in the mid terms Considering how hated Trump is there will be more losses than usual Say hello to a Blue Congress and the end of Punkin Head ,liberal

Up vote because I do think it s a fair question and I don t think the down votes are warranted To me the merits of incrementalism are not taking things for granted and minimizing unintended consequences When I see injustice I too want it rectified and quickly That said I think there is a value for societies to have a tension between the conservative impulse to maintain the status quo and the liberal impulse to improve society Big steps have big shock waves and may inflect greater unforeseen injustices Stability should be prized and carefully maintained because it doesn t arise naturally and is difficult to rebuild when a tipping point is reached and collapse occurs The fair counterpoint to this view is that it gives cover to conservatives and turns Liberals into self satisfied Reactionaries The only answer to this counterpoint is that it is incumbent on those of Liberal impulse to resist the desire to be self satisfied Society needs us to maintain our part of the tension and continue p,liberal

Unfortunately I think that bringing so much attention to the fact that it s currently a 50 50 split with Pence as the deciding vote will make it harder to get a Republican to oppose the DeVos confirmation If a Republican now comes out and pledges to vote no he or she will be treated like a major traitor to the Republican party Since most congress critters put their chances to be reelected above god country party family and just about anything else you can imagine it seems unlikely that someone one will have the courage to speak their mind and oppose the nomination Ad with most opinions I ve had lately let s hope that I m wrong ,liberal
If three responsible GOP senators wanted to pretty much shut down DT s insanity they could pull a Jim Jeffords resign from GOP caucus with the Dems flip the Senate and bring some order to this clusterfuk They could also just form a gang of 3 and moderate the WH without leaving the GOP The problem here is that the swamp isn t being drained what DT is doing is poisoning the well DT is out of his league and is risking serious damage to the interests of the US at home and abroad He s fomenting a revolution which really isn t a great thing to be doing from a social stability standpoint A little moderation on his outrageous behavior could save his ass as well as ours Just saying The GOP of my youth was USA first not GOP first ,liberal

This is from my facebook Implement single payer government funded healthcare and there won t be a problem with guns because everyone will have access to mental health professionals And if you think it s a matter cost if we simply reduced our America has got to be the world police budget by 10 percent we could afford to pay for health care for everyone EDIT UPDATE I concede the point that my assertion about paying for it by reducing the defense budget was unfounded according to current estimates Having said that I still 100 believe that solving the mental health crisis in America which I believe mass shootings are a symptom of starts with ensuring everyone has access to and sometimes is forced to use mental and physical healthcare ,liberal
I don t want to pay for other people s healthcare Literally doesn t fucking understand health insurance ,liberal
GOP compromise free medical care for gunshot victims after they prove the wounds were not self inflicted ,liberal
Not from the US but surely technically this is true with regards to your constitution Does the constitution say you have a right to health care like you do to bare arms Also I always assumed that amendment was in reference to civilian militias perhaps against the government ,liberal
I think both are rights ,liberal
The GOP insists that the Vegas shooter s gun arsenal is a right but medical treatment for his 500 survivors is merely a privilege Trying to conflate completely different things the right to own and bear a firearm vs the right to someone else s medical services and portraying them as backwards is disgusting The constitution does not say anything about you being entitled to someone else s medical service but it does say you have the right to bear arms not the same as entitled to free firearms government won t give you free firearms ,liberal
removed ,liberal
Private ownership vs free services Is this a parody sub or are you people really that tone deaf ,liberal
The difference is he payed for all of those gun He didn t force someone else to pay for them You can pay for your medical care no one is denying you that right You cannot force someone else to pay for it for you I m not paying for your medical care but I m also not expecting you to pay for mine either How is this so hard to understand ,liberal
Healthcare is a right just like guns buy your own ,liberal
I thought the guns he had were illegal for the most part ,liberal
I know this will offend people but to be perfectly crass and honest guns especially semi automatic guns or large arsenals of them sound to me a naive European like a similar extension of one s manhood that owning a big car is in other countries Perhaps unless one is an avid shooting range user and thus equates them more to something like a tennis racket or other hobby item Thoughts Edit Gotten way too many 30 responses and in the process of reading them probably quintupled my knowledge of firearms That s enough but thanks for the replies ,liberal
Without getting into the pro anti gun argument or the pro anti government mandated healthcare argument there is a big difference between allowing the possession of something and requiring the purchase of something as far as rights are concerned ,liberal

Gun Violence isn t the problem it s the symptom Normal happy healthy well adjusted individuals who are educated gainfully employed feel accepted by their peers friends and family and who have a sense of belonging in society generally do not commit suicide They generally do not engage in gang activities or the upper or mid levels of the black market drug trade They generally don t engage in violent crimes nor do they shoot up schools We have severe systemic problems in our society that lead individuals to feel disconnected and lost to not have a purpose or meaning in life If we can alleviate these issues we ll have a massive impacts on violent crime and gun violence in this nation I have no delusion that solving those problems won t be hard but it s the only way How Universal Basic Income People who have access to the standards of living don t need to engage in the drug trade or crime as a means to gain money to survive Free or subsidized higher education and day care Quality daycare fr,liberal
I m not getting into the argument of either 2a rights or universal healthcare but that comparison doesn t hold The right to guns does not equate to the government providing you guns at no cost it gives you the right to purchase them yourself just as some one can pay for healthcare All I m saying is the comparison in the title is very misleading as to what the actual situation is ,liberal
Then change the Constitution ,liberal
This is a dumb message It would make sense if the gun was provided to him by the state like single payer would be In this case it s more like the right to buy guns and the survivors do have the right to buy healthcare ,liberal
Which proves that the GOP can read the Constitution ,liberal
This doesn t really make sense Taxpayers didn t buy that guy s guns ,liberal
deleted ,liberal
So single payer gun ownership then Big difference in buying your own guns vs having other people pay subsidize your medical costs ,liberal
Owning a gun is a right but you still have to pay for it People aren t getting free guns from the government I think the comparison fails here I m all for single payer I m just saying this isn t a well thought out argument ,liberal
Show me in the US Constitution where it says Healthcare is a right Not saying that we shouldn t do something to fix the Healthcare system in America but it was never explicitly stated as a right so this is not even an argument just a false comparison ,liberal

Okay yeah but how exactly is anyone supposed to make a removal happen the makeup of the NSC is purely upon the pleasure of the President We currently have a President that is beholden to no one and no party and generally DGAF Who exactly is going to talk Trump into ditching his main man Bannon from the NSC What leverage is there and what does it matter anyways Trump is going to Trump and take his advice and guidance from those he chooses regardless of what anyone else has to say about it ,liberal
As usual Sanders sees through the bullshit to the important things When this whole immigration shit storm started I told my girlfriend to look for what s happening in the background because you don t mishandle something that badly unless it s on purpose Low and behold less than a day later it s quietly announced that Bannon is on the security council Then we find out a few hours after that that the DHS originally interpreted the immigration EO to NOT include green card holders and Bannon countermanded that instructing them to suspend green card travel as well Steve Bannon is a horrible human being but he isn t stupid He knew what kind of media circus that decision would cause Note I m not saying the immigration issue isn t important but I think this has the potential to be a much larger problem for the country Both have to be fought but we can t loose focus on this just because the immigration issue is getting all the attention ,liberal

Let s remember that this was a calculated move She was Secretary of State it s not like she is unable to step up to the challenge of a debate with Sanders So why this move What is she getting out of this Well as long as she keeps no debates Bernie s face is out of the media in NY and people who aren t familiar with him can blame him because of his tone How do we combat this Bernie should do a town hall without Hillary Bernie should host a rally in Central Park or Wall Street Bernie should go to NY Universities like Cornell I m a mere citizen I trust in Bernie and his campaign advisors ,liberal

Well yeah The 80 billion to the pentagon gets spent on contracts and companies that the rich can invest in and make money on Putting money into educating the public doesn t give a good return to the ultra rich and simply improves the country immensely and prepares us to compete with the rest of the world going forward ,liberal
The essential act of war is destruction not necessarily of human lives but of the products of human labour War is a way of shattering to pieces or pouring into the stratosphere or sinking in the depths of the sea materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable and hence in the long run too intelligent Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed http www george orwell org 1984 16 html ,liberal

quick math there are about 3 4 million american highschool graduates every year Let s assume 75 of them want to go to college once it s free Times 4 years that s 10 2 million people in college at any one time What is the actual cost of a year in college Ignoring the bullshit outliers like Harvard at 50k I think that 15 000 is pretty reasonable So by that math I get about 153 Billion per year I actually don t know what s in Bernie s plan but i can see how with some other assumptions you could get to 70 Billion in free tuition assuming only state schools are funded costs might be lower than i guessed assuming only about half of all highschool students choose free state schools income verification etc Also even if it IS 150 Billion that s only 4 of the federal budget I d say that s probably worth doing ,liberal

Real leadership real America power is not shown by our ability to blow things up but by our ability as the leading and the most power national on Earth to bring parties together to forge international consensus That war in Iraq cost us trillions of dollars Money that should have been spent on healthcare education infrastructure environmental protection In other words it is easy to give a powerful speech about why we have to go to war But it is far more important that we do everything that we can to solve global conflicts without going to war the power of diplomacy that in my view is what real leadership is about Bernie https www youtube com watch v vL7jR7bMECA feature youtu be t 5714 Sanders Feb 27th A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual doom Martin Luther King Jr That the mainstream media isn t asking where this money comes from exposes their hypocrisy This infographic helps me visuali,liberal

Yeah nothing like a free ride for 4 years so you can get that useless religious studies or nutrition degree At least the military budget employs people ,liberal

We don t need defense NK is no threat ISIS isn t real not to mention that dod does much to help the population after natural disasters such as hurricanes etc Just give people free college and it ll all be alright Sounds myopic to me ,liberal

Remember everyone We no longer live in an age where you should take any comment at face value Evaluate what you read even what I have written Use your resourcefulness and initiative to discover if whatever you have just read is at all accurate Use perspective imagine what the anonymous party on the other end might stand to gain by influencing how you feel about the issue For example I can tell you that comments opposing the reopening of this subreddit are a vocal minority We ve seen in discussion over at the sister subreddit r political_revolution that popular sentiment is overwhelmingly in favor of reopening Most importantly don t let the people who are discouraging discussion or spreading hysteria affect your morale If any part of you would like to again join the movement towards creating a more progressive government one that works for all of us and not just 1 of us than you re in the right place Welcome back ,liberal
His press release http www sanders senate gov newsroom press releases sanders joins senate democratic leadership Real change doesn t take place on Capitol Hill It takes place in grassroots America It takes place when millions of working people young people and senior citizens come together to demand that our government works for all of us and not just the 1 percent When the people lead the leaders follow Serving as ranking member of the Budget Committee is a heavy responsibility It helps shape the priorities of the United States government and I am going to do everything I can to make sure the budget that leaves the United States Congress is a budget that represents the needs of working families and a shrinking middle class not billionaires ,liberal
I mean yeah this is a good thing but are they putting him here so that he can t take a more influential role This sounds like one of those promoted out of the way situations Hopefully Sanders can lead more progressive members into greater positions ,liberal

Why is everyone on here just arguing and complaining Bernie accepted this position and didnt he say he didn t want to be senate minority leader anyway Either way can we stop with the im so mad about this Because you know what i m mad about That a racist demagogue is now president republicans have control over everything and here we are arguing over whether or not this role is suitable for a man who accepted this role Im sure people will downvote me but can everyone just calm the hell down and stop whining when every little thing doesnt go the way you feel it should If the man accepted this position and endorsed Schumer as minority leader then cant we agree that maybe just maybe he knows what he is doing here and work on our own organizing about how we are going to go forward after this giant fucking mess Fuck We are all on the same team here and complaining and whining about this is going to get us nowhere ,liberal
A Reminder of What Things Were Like at r SandersForPresident least we forget There are rumblings of a revivification of the r SandersForPresident subreddit I thought it might be helpful for the community to revisit its history to see whether that is something that should be encouraged or opposed Through the end of 2015 into early 2016 r SandersForPresident was a vibrant massively growing exciting community It was a place where one could be educated inspired moved to tears of beauty or laugh for joy It was the first place we all went to to understand our place in this brave new world that was unfolding right before our eyes Not only unfolding as we watched but unfolding because WE were making it happen Many of us got our first taste of activism by contributing in that group s4p taught us how WE could be the change that changes the world Starting around March 2016 weird stuff started happening Deletions bannings without rhyme or reason arbitrary inexplicable began consuming posts Not jus,liberal

I have a serious question I have no true horse in the race as I am not an American I just watched the C Span video or at least the recount part How is that considered a democratic vote It looks like it is a high school gym that has people divided in half Which is fine assuming everyone was registered to vote and signed in etc but during the recount the lady literally only asked Who missed the original count How is that considered democratic Anyone could ve piped up and announced that they missed the first vote and they were just added to the to the original count How do they not do a complete recount and I mean anonymous recount Give people their ballot and a box and let them place their vote They can stand on whichever side of the gym that they want with their family pastors school teachers whoever and vote anonymously for the candidate that they think is best What a joke I am sorry America Whoever wins whether it is who you want or not that is just shady ,liberal
Whether or not this is legit I d strongly suggest not getting too crazy about this It will make us look like conspiracy nutjobs and Hillary s campaign will play it off as sour grapes This campaign in Iowa accomplished a shit ton Win the next few convincingly leave no doubt and don t get baited into a finger pointing matchup It s too god damn early to wonder what could ve been and whine There s too much work to do ,liberal

Unbelievable What a clusterfuck P S That woman Don t you want to show your daughter a woman can be president As a woman I CAN T STAND this If you want to vote for Hilary do so because you agree with her policies not because she has a vagina I hate it when women list her sex as a valid reason why she deserves to be the leader of the free world Because we ve never had one before is utterly stupid Why don t we wait for the RIGHT female candidate ,liberal

It seems fitting that a group that we as a country have largely forgotten about our military veterans were able to be national heroes once again I wonder if this means we could see an uptick in the political activism of our veterans going forward It s hard for the government and local law enforcement to deny rights to groups like Native Americans and military veterans without immediately looking like the bad guys It might turn out to be an incredibly effective political force Remember this next time someone asks what protesting can accomplish ,liberal
Man not a single comment about the content posted If you want to debate the meta of the moderators make a separate post If you want the sub dead don t participate If you want it alive discuss the material I am glad Bernie is still a vocal figurehead for the progressive left He s one of the only high profile candidates who is taking hard stances against such an oppressive action ,liberal

But not listening to the millions who do want it built ,liberal
The pipeline is probably 95 complete so not being built is a stretch Its also being rerouted not stopped Nothing was gained here The natives get a win and the oil company spends a little more money on extra pipe Life goes on The entire issue could have been avoided from the jump if the idiots had just brought the natives to the table or avoided them completely ,liberal

Just dropping an idea in here last week on a different thread I was telling that several years ago when in my country Berlusconi was filling every show and newscast of his TV network with biased messages many cultural organizations left wing parties some VIPs and other well known personalities informed the Italian public that they were willing to boycott the sponsors products advertised on those channels that weren t providing independent information It caused a big stir Sponsors are very sensitive when it comes to their consumers complaints and they feared that the initiative could lead to a mass boycott action So since they pay the TV networks for advertising and they have quite a say they joined the protest and started lobbying for a better and balanced TV information BTW this campaign was launched by Umberto Eco RIP Have a read In the stranglehold of the Tycoon http cms ifa de index php id 6774 L 1 This is the original Italian version Lo sciopero dei consumatori della pasta Cunegon,liberal
This is unbelievable I kid you not there were three blocks of the nightly news covering the Trumpvs Shill fight not one single mention of Bernie not even oh that crazy cook is still at it No matter what happens this is the single worst display of news organizations bias to try and persuade people that what is really happening isn t It s unprecedented when you take into account viral and social media It s a bizarre Orwellian affair watching it all unfold When Bernie comes ahead in delegates I can t even image what the MSM will be doing But one thing is for sure they will try and pretend that the greatest comeback was unforeseeable and that they were fair the entire time We have all the evidence we need to show this was a complete bias across the board ,liberal
Awesome turnout We need to be Bernie s media ,liberal
It baffles when I see these yuge Bernie rallies with 10 s of thousands of people and its never really aired on major news networks and not once during this primary have I seen a Clinton rally with even half the amount of people and it gets aired constantly Other than the primary election system being extremely corrupt and rigged HOW THE HELL IS HILLARY WINNING RIGHT NOW ,liberal
I get really excited when I see stuff like this However living in Brooklyn and being constantly surrounded by tons of Bernie supporters it s startling how many people support him through rallies and social media but cannot and did not actually vote in the primary I suggest for anyone here living in a state which hasn t voted yet go to a rally and ask random attendees if they re actually eligible to vote the results may be eye opening depressing ,liberal

They actually talked about this on my local news I live in the bay area near San Francisco and it was great because they were like Sanders packed an entire stadium who roared in agreement throughout his speech and cheered him on the whole way through then continued on for about five minutes about how much support he had and how incredible it was and how excited everyone was then at the end they added on the other side Hillary opened an office in Oakland There were dozens of supporters ,liberal
congrats trump does this literally every single time he throws an event ,liberal
This will get buried but this article is factually inaccurate KCRA is not the only local station that covered it Every single station in the Sacramento market covered it and heavily Our station had three reporters on Bernie s rally all day There were countless reporters cameras photographers there including national media coverage I love Bernie too so let s not get swept up in a narrative that s just not true ,liberal
They re silent because it is irrelevant ,liberal
For the life of me I just don t understand this sub s obsession with packing stadiums I ve lost count of how many times I ve opened up Reddit and found MEDIA SILENT AS BERNIE PACKS on the front page as if that s something that should interrupt regularly scheduled programming The campaign would do well to get more voters to the polls and win enough delegates to challenge Clinton then it would do by constantly harping on just how big of a crowd he spoke to last night ,liberal

Bernie knew all along He just couldn t say anything without proof Otherwise the media would blast him for biased accusations and paint him as a conspiracy theorist The powers that be have done a great job of painting a huge negative tone to people presenting possibly conspiracy theories Even though a lot of them could be true ,liberal
I d have thought that after Sanders endorsed Hillary this sub would become r HillaryForPresident where every anti Clinton post would get the axe I m pleasantly surprised Cheers to the mods for keeping it this way ,liberal

The only way Clinton could have won the popular vote is through rigged fraudulent elections These election results are one of the many testaments to how truly powerful her reach through her connections are Bernie Sanders would have won the popular vote if the elections weren t rigged and fraudulent and this country would be in a different place at this point and Trump would be even more of a non entity ,liberal
Every response to these leaks I ve seen read today from the Democrat party is to ignore what the leaks are saying and push a theory of Trump Putin collusion Looks like the marching orders have been handed down Who cares how it was discovered If I find a steaming pile of dog shit in my yard whether I stepped in it or my neighbor pointed it out to me it s still a steaming pile of dog shit It doesn t change the fact that its still shit ,liberal
I think we can all agree Trump winning the RNC has been an excellent demonstration of how the DNC has absolutely created a system which allows them to fully manipulate their results despite their being widespread appetite for non traditional candidate The RNC tried to control the masses but failed I m hopeful that there will be a changing of the guard in both parties and real progress can be made ,liberal

Pardon my ignorance but it seems like there s proof to show that the Democratic voting wasn t fair so should there be any re votes or a Hillary disqualification ,liberal
This whole situation is the reason I have never affiliated with any party I may only be 29 years old but I know a corrupt system when I see it How is it possible that in a True Democracy that there are only ever two candidates from the same two parties year in and year out Yes there are many other choices and we can vote for them but as long as the corporate media is where most americans get there information from those parties will never get the recognition they deserve This year is especially fantastic because the fear mongering seems to have switched sides I am expected to vote for a corrupt candidate because I should be scared of the other corrupt candidate This is never a good enough answer for where my vote should go Until the current election system is completely overhauled we will never be a truly democratic nation The people s vote truly does not matter I beg everyone to vote based on policies and actions not based on looks or fear mongering and most of all please please do no,liberal

In 2008 we had 26 debates and 8 candidates In the end we had six straight up debates between Obama and Clinton In 2016 we had a much smaller pool We had one debate with five candidates 3 debates with three candidates and then five matchups between Clinton and Sanders What s the big difference there ,liberal
If Trump wins and shits everything apart a Bernie ticket would be highly attractive for 2020 If Hillary wins nothing will change till 2024 ,liberal

In a different reality O Malley would ve been a standout candidate He s got the charisma he s almost always on topic and nails the talking point he s basically what if you would ve asked me a decade ago a prime presidential candidate would look like But this is not that reality if you aren t crooked af or willing to fear monger then there is no place for you at the top Crazy times indeed ,liberal
I mean this in the best possible way but aren t both the major US parties just private organisations existing to promote their own goals and agendas Why would they support anyone else It s not on their interests to be fair and there s no law compelling them to be fair Isn t that just the way your system is set up I understand that alternative candidates need to make use of the political apparatus that exist and that it must be frustrating when these apparatuses turn out to favour their own candidates and not the one you like but why would you expect them to be balanced It makes no sense to me The republican and democratic parties are private not government institutions and have no obligations to be fair If you want change you need to alter those systems first ,liberal

Biden should have said this much much earlier when Hillary is using Obama as the meat shield for everything ,liberal
Biden is a superdelegate Words mean nothing actions matter We ll see which way he votes ,liberal
This part of what Biden said I like the idea of saying We can do much more because we can Biden said I don t think any Democrat s ever won saying We can t think that big we ought to really downsize here because it s not realistic C mon man this is the Democratic Party I m not part of the party that says Well we can t do it That is exactly what Hillary and her supporters have been saying it s not realistic what Bernie proposes and Biden said he didn t think any Dem had ever won saying that hmmmmmm ,liberal

OH FOR CHRIST SAKES JOE IF YOU BELIEVED THAT IT SURE AS SHIT WOULD HAVE BEEN A WHOLE HELL OF A LOT MORE USEFUL FOR YOU TO SAY THAT BACK IN FEBRUARY God dammit I mean I m glad he finally said something Anyone that knows Joe knows he would like Bernie more than Hillary but god dammit he should have shown support for Sanders back when there was regular media coverage trying to convince him to join the race That probably would have carried a ton of weight but seeing that Obama is trying to shove Hillary down our throats Joe probably didn t want to be seen as cutting the President out at his knees ,liberal
Biden making a play for party unity Expect more tone it down announcements to come as we head towards June ,liberal
No Everyone in the Democrat High Command are behaving in a gracious manner now to try and elevate Bernie because they no longer consider him a threat Obama Biden the Superdelegates all these people recognize they have to round up the cattle to vote for Hillary and the best way to do that is to pretend they respect Bernie when they have had nothing but contempt for him all along They still hold that contempt and they ll abandon all those ideas as soon as they ve got your vote because once they ve got your vote they ve got the power and they won t need you any longer ,liberal
He was just going on and on about how amazing Clinton is not even a week ago The play at unity is on full effect here ,liberal

Well Bernie s ideas in my eyes are the only way forward for Democratic party ,liberal
I really hope all you folks in the Sanders camp are smarter than to fall for this bullshit This article seems to be implying that people like Sanders and Clinton are moving in the same direction or Bernie s agenda is somehow in line with the Democratic Party leadership It s not It goes directly against it Just like Trump is splitting the GOP Sanders ought to split the Dems These calls for unity only favor Clinton and other pro oligarchy imperialists ,liberal

As a somewhat Conservative person familiar with Democrat party slight of hand let me break this down Biden is a friendly face that they use to elude to compassion He says that he likes sanders positions but consider this The Patriot Act was based on the Omnibus counterterrorism act of 1995 which was in part drafted under his direction doesnt sound like Sanders to me sounds like an establishment shill like Hillary The Democratic party constantly does this they put out a progressive face a person that they use publicly to make you feel all warm inside The truth is that they are the ones that use progressive programs to funnel money into percieved Republican programs its about using a good cop bad cop persona to make us feel like we are getting a good deal So when they roll out Biden they are for better or worse trying to keep you from leaving the party for a third party when Sanders loses so they can keep power and keep growing government ,liberal
The DNC and the Clinton campaign won t be expecting me to fall in line with their cries of unity ,liberal
Before everyone doubts that Biden is being truthful remember two things Biden and Hillary never really got along http www nytimes com 2015 10 22 us politics warm in public joe biden and hillary clinton have been intense rivals in private html and Joe Biden has no filter ,liberal
He s taking a step in the right direction Next step is endorsement If not this rhetoric is very empty ,liberal
Claiming that wages and taxes are the only reason why companies moved overseas is bullshit These companies are dodging EPA and other Federal regs China is still producing toys with lead and using lead paint The smog issues in China are because of lack of environmental regulations that the US has It s sad because the companies that fled the US to avoid EPA are killing the Chinese His platform is bullshit and he is piece of shit ,liberal
And now today Donald Trump has reversed his position and is saying wages are too low It s kind of cute in a morbid way seeing Donald Trump learn how to be a traditional politician ,liberal
I m more stymied by the fact that he claimed we were being beaten militarily We ve got more military might than the next 10 countries combined ,liberal

If past Trump outrages are anything to go by this will somehow only make him stronger ,liberal
I m going to post what I posted in another thread Except it s not a lie because in this context Trump is making the claim that if wages are too high and taxes are too high we won t be able to compete That s his argument against raising minimum wage and it is completely different than saying current wages are too high Edit I knew trying to bring sense into a Bernie Sanders sub wouldn t work You all have so much to attack Trump over but instead you just stretch his words and misinterpret them Unbelievable ,liberal
The thing that frustrates me the most is that now we have to spend time and energy talking not about the wage issue but whether DT lied This is a very insidious way that candidates detract from real issues Ugh ,liberal

I know we don t mind hearing this but the right wing Washington Times wrote this to turn mainstream dems against Bernie ,liberal
His primary challenger former Labor Secretary Tom Perez told The Huffington Post in December that he wants to learn from Senator Sanders about how he did it Learn how he did it They want to learn how he did it That s how you know they are doomed they failed to see that the reason he did it was because people actually liked the message and liked having a politician who was honest and forthright with the people and treated voters like adults instead of children with short attention spans ,liberal

That s a lie about Ellison saying he d get the donor list from Bernie Keith was referring to a different list when the question was asked not the donor list ,liberal
Okay so they were mad at him not being a true democrat and still say he has no place telling democrats who should lead them but they want him to give them his list as if he was Sorry that isn t how this works You don t get to criticize belittle badger and cheat a man and his supporters and then expect to be able to use their resources ,liberal
Hello DNC It s me For many of those donors Sanders was the first Democratic presidential candidate they had supported or the first politician they had ever helped Yes there are many of me I just want to take the opportunity to remind you that I registered as a Democrat solely to vote for Bernie Sanders in the primaries you rigged against him After which I withdrew my party registration and you can be certain that you won t get a dime from me in the future Sincerely Already moved abroad ,liberal

The DNC won t get my money because they don t represent my interests I d just as soon see the entire party torn to the ground as I would the Republicans The fact that they are trying milk Bernie for his donor lists just goes to show at least to me just how fatally out of touch they are with what should have been a key constituency for them If they survive this whole debacle and are rebuilt from the ground up I ll look at what has risen from the ashes Until then my door and my wallet are closed to them ,liberal

My father is a lifelong Republican White former automotive executive hates both Obama and Sarah Palin but moderate on social issues He has never donated to any candidate Then he watched Bernie s address at the Iowa primary And that night my father pulled out his credit card and gave him 27 I could not understand it Bernie s message resonated deeply with a lot of people He tapped into the same sense of injustice that Trump did he just resonated with different people Fuck the DNC for killing democracy in the primaries Now they have their reward and I hope they fucking choke on it ,liberal

If Hilary was unapologetic about taking money from her donors and made it a point that her politics was uninfluenced by her donations then fine I honestly couldn t care who gives her what if I felt she was someone I could trust But this goes way beyond an issue with money in politics This is someone clearly going far out of their way to cover something up because they don t want the average Joe hearing their real views Even if you like and support Hilary and even if you have no problem with money in politics this shows unquestionably that she can t be trusted If she actually manages to become president do people thing this kind of crap will suddenly stop This is just the start ,liberal

There should be a grassroots movement that EDUCATES people on what Single Payer is Which means that there should be an actuarial and financial pitch and people should go out even in red countries and break it down for people whose only information source is Fox news Not via the internet not rehashing ideological point of views but rather a practical reasoning face to face of why collective bargaining minimal bureaucracy and augmented preventive care are the decisive factors that make Single Payer the best option for most Americans ,liberal

This is why going on the offense which usually has been the best establishment strategy doesn t work when you go against someone in politics who has been an outcast Trying to attack and smear Bernie will never work because he has CREDIBILITY HONESTY INTEGRITY and is CONSISTENT He has never swayed on his beliefs which is the basis of his counter attacking strategy and it will always work I love this game within the game To all thinking he ain t got the brains to manoeuvre within the system think again This is as intelligent a strategy I ve ever seen No mudslinging no personal attacks Neat politics and Bernie is running a terrific campaign ,liberal

No wonder Bernie looked so happy yesterday on TV interviews the President just reiterated his stump speech and he knew he had this coming out this afternoon Hopefully national media shows this adds to the do whatever to get votes argument against Clinton ,liberal
I feel like I might be the only one as I scroll by countless Berns but I feel like Bernie is actually saddened by the tactics that Hillary has resulted in having to use in order to stay ahead in the polls The Daily Show attack today was just sad and I think this picture isn t an attack as much as it s just a remember when And that s why Bernie is going to win because he s not going to attack an opponent he s going to stay focused on the problem ,liberal
Damn you ALMOST have to feel sorry for Hillary Almost ,liberal
and to think a lot of us were saying he s way too soft on Hillary not that long ago Amazing ,liberal
I am here to say it is not only wrong but it is undermining core Democratic principles Since when do Democrats attack one another on universal healthcare I thought we were trying to realize Harry Truman s dream This is wrong and every Democrat should be outraged This is the kind of attack that not only undermines core Democratic values but gives aid and comfort to the very special interests and their allies in Republican Party that are against doing what we want to do for America Shame on you Hillary Rodham Clinton 2008 ,liberal

The last few days have been such a whirlwind Hillary is digging her own grave and people are recognizing that Bernie is the answer I have strongly supported Sanders since March in June my best friend asked me my real thoughts on Bernie becoming President At that time I told him about 5 In September October he asked again I told him honestly about 35 Today I m at like 90 I almost can t contain myself WE RE GOING TO GET THIS MAN ELECTED I am not going to stop phonebanking donating and trying to convert anyone I can but the tide is completely turning and it is a thing of beauty to witness ,liberal

Imagine President Sanders facing a vote in Congress on free college tuition paid for by a tax hike on the wealthy He d have to persuade Speaker of the House John Boehner to help him pass the bill That s where his army of activists comes in How do I convince John Is my personality that much better than Barack Obama s Sanders says The answer is to say Hey John take a look out your window Because there are a million young people there that are in support of the legislation They are voting They know what s going on If you refuse to make college affordable they re going to vote your people out of office That s the offer you can t refuse I ve been waiting for that moment since Boehner was named Speaker EDIT For the r all twat brigade this quote IMHO isn t even about free college its about Boehner not allowing anything to come to the floor that he personally disagrees with no matter how many people want it EDIT 2 Thanks for the gold anonymous stranger ,liberal

ELI5 1 The DNC and Hillary have a joint committee called Hillary Victory Fund HVF which can accept up to 356 100 in individual donations unlike 2 700 which is the maximum an individual can contribute to Hillary for this primary directly Of this 2 700 is the maximum that can go to Hillary s campaign Hillary for America HFA 2 The HVF can coordinate with any state Democratic party and with the DNC itself The HVF can donate of the 356 100 33 400 to the DNC and up to 10 000 if they wish to to any of the 32 participating state Democratic parties in the HVF 3 The Sanders campaign alleges that HVF is subsidizing HFA indirectly In particular HVF has spent so far around 15 million in online and direct mail advertisements These adverts promote people donating money mostly to HFA and the donations do not benefit either the DNC or the state Democratic parties 4 Initially the advert money used by HVF was small Now it is being spent at a magnitude that this spending can no longer be ignored as it dir,liberal
I wish they would ve done this 24 hours ago But they are pretty much calling out Hillary s corruption with money in politics And they have citations in the letter That s some crazy shit ,liberal
Wow I mean that s a pretty serious allegation right The Clinton Foundation http imgur com ECD4uOa ,liberal
To simplify this for people who don t understand it Hillary and the DNC are laundering money into her campaign They got her billionaire puppet masters to donate to the DNC after already maxing out on 2700 contributions directly to her and then funnel the majority of it back into her campaign This is also why she had a few hundered supledelegates before the campaign even began because they gave some of the money to the superdelegates Basically they bought superdelegates and laundered money into her campaign ,liberal

The advert never mentions Bernie by name I agree the implication is there but if we push back the Clinton camp will claim that it s contrasting her with the Republicans not Sanders They ll cite Bernie s Wallstreet advert as an example of him doing the same thing and it ll look like he went negative first Just relax the fact that she s doing this means that she s out of ideas Just wait for the Bernie Weaver calm response where they take the high road Until then by all means donate phonebank etc but don t get hung up on petty stuff like this ,liberal

I wouldn t go out on the attack It s not necessarily an attack on Bernie but it s rather implied Lets keep going positive Instead of giving Hillary s add more views share Bernie s two ads or donate or phone bank WWWD WhatWouldWeaverDo Negative attention does our campaign no good unless it comes from Weaver ,liberal
Just watched the video Just gonna say that it s directed towards the GOP edit people we need to stop reacting to the video of course there is an implied attack on Bernie but if we were Bernie we would be like ignoring it Otherwise acknowledging it would be detrimental to his campaign So wait for a new ad to pop out which will somewhat be in response to the Hillary ad but with much positive force in it ,liberal
The video doesn t really make an impact at all I would give it a score of D for effectiveness Business as usual Berners I wouldn t bother sharing it Bernie s videos are so magnificently effective at getting his message accross that there would be no point in sending this video also instead Bernie s volunteer videos are all you need ,liberal
released an ad attacking Bernie I m sorry what That ad attacked Bernie about as much as his Wall Street ad attacked Hillary Not much I m not voting for Bernie because Hillary is the devil she s not I m voting for Bernie cause he s the best Y all act like Hillary would be the worst president ever The truth is she s perfectly capable and while it s clear she wouldn t push progressive issues nearly as much as Bernie she isn t going to make the U S as ass backwards as Trump or Cruz likely would Keep the focus on why Bernie s the best people Rise above the dirty politics ,liberal
You guys need to stop seeing anything coming out of her camp as an attack on Bernie It s a positive commercial for her period It s not bad actually If I didn t know what the heck was going on I d say it s a good ad and not mind if she got elected ,liberal

I have a lot of problems with this ad but the part about health care is really not attacking him Her stance is now that we have the ACA we should be working to expand it into something resembling universal health care rather than replace it with a single payer system I disagree because it s way more expensive but it s really just showing their differences The parts about attacking planned parenthood and supporting the gun lobby though that s just bullshit She thinks she can get away with it because she didn t say his name ,liberal
How does this get 6000 up votes The ad doesn t even mention Bernie by name The fact that this is 1 on r all is embarrassing as fuck ,liberal
Hilary flip flops on gay marriage Hilary flip flops on the best way to administer health care According to Elizabeth Warren Hilary has flip flopped on bankruptcy laws and is now clearly on the side of big business and multinationals now that she s trying to get elected into powerful positions And you know what So did Obama So does every god damned politician because it s how politics work right now You re all going to be running in place on issues of economics healthcare education the military industrial complex private prisons all of these things the needle will barely move in the direction of positive change ,liberal

Have any of you actually listened to what Hillary said about Bernie s healthcare plan specifically the part where she uses the exact words that OP is calling an attack She s used the phrase I want to build on Obamacare not start over in every single debate thus far His healthcare proposal would in fact be starting over because it would supersede Obamacare in its entirety This is all starting to sound like trivial hate for hate s sake ,liberal
To be honest Hillary and Obama have always sounded like moderate Republicans to me I never understood what was so appealing about supporting either of them other than their supposed chances of appealing to moderates Bill and Hillary Clinton have always seemed to play politics like a game and do typically political things rather than just be honest The reason I voted for Obama is because I would rather have a moderate Republican in office than a far right Republican And it payed off in ways like having better LGBT rights I think it s important that we and the Democrat party start getting behind people who are genuinely and consistently progressive rather than people who try to be moderate and play politics Because I always feel that it s taking a chance with civil rights and the livelihood of the poor and people in general And may say something progressive to make a progressive happy and then turn around and do something Conservative to make a Conservative happy For instance I worry tha,liberal

Wait there are democrats who don t want universal healthcare Dude you end up spending 4 000 yr in taxes instead of 8 000 yr in medical bills There s literally no reason not to have universal healthcare ,liberal
I m sorry but if Bernie s ad wasn t an attack on Hillary then this is certainly not an attack on Bernie Attack ads are easily distinguishable from other political ads For starters an attack ad would never never ever ever so prominently feature the candidate by name as well as with imagery that they were meant to benefit This is clearly a pro Clinton ad Hell go YouTube ANY attack ad and you will notice the fear music used compared to what is used here ,liberal
Well she doesn t implicitly say who wants to start over And since Bernie s plan doesn t start over that is why it is called Medicare for all she could be attacking anyone The other point is true in 2008 she wanted universal healthcare 8 years later she doesn t want universal healthcare What gives I __hope__ she wasn t saying that in 2008 just to contrast herself on as many issues as possible with Obama and then attack him on it Now she seems to be taking the other side so she can contrast her plans with Bernie and attack him ,liberal

It seems like a lot of the people here are missing the point of what Bernie is saying He s demonstrating why the uber rich oligarchs don t care about SS it doesn t do anything for them They have already have massive amounts of money and they receive massive retirement packages That s the reason they have no problem influencing politicians to pursue SS cuts To rich people SS Medicare and Medicaid are all net negatives which increase their taxes while not providing them with serious benefits To the much larger proportion of lower and middle class people these programs are necessities for a comfortable retirement ,liberal
How can they just cut social security That will leave almost every retiree very financially strapped I don t know anyone in my life who is retired who could say Aw I don t need that check every month you can just stop sending me them Also we ve been paying and paying in what happened to all the benefit I am paying in each check to receive when I retire Where did it go I honestly want to know I m not an idiot just very hard for the average person to figure out WHY it isn t going to be there Very pro Bernie person here ,liberal

I don t see how getting a large retirement package relates to an oligarchy ,liberal
I m no fan of this guy but this is actually the way it should have happened imo He could have left with a pension in the form of stock in XOM that would have left him beholden to the interests of the corporation while in office Instead he cashed that in and is setting the money aside for the duration which I appreciate Obviously the fact that he did the right thing here is nothing to indicate that he will behave in an ethical manner towards things like Russia or obvious XOM points of interest which he d be aware of given his insider status in their business development plans but we can at least say that he s not directly increasing his own wealth by doing things to raise XOM share values Like I said I m not a fan of the pick here but this all seems to have been done correctly If you want to complain about something it would be the fact that he was valued so highly by XOM comparative to their other employees in the first place but given that valuation he has divested himself appropriate,liberal

I feel like I ve seen a ton of really old and really relevant photos and videos of Bernie since he started running displaying him supporting the causes he stands for and is preaching about that Hillary is trying to bullshit claim as well specifically civil rights gay rights yet almost none of this is being used by Bernie in his talking points or in any official media I was glad to finally see during the town hall the other night he did for once address how he was an actual on the ground protester of civil rights There are heaps of evidence of Bernie fighting for justice among standard citizens and actually being punished for it all while there are actual videos on Youtube of Hillary opposing gay rights and evidence of her supporting groups that hurt the progress of minorities I m sick of turning on the news and hearing interview after interview of citizens saying they are voting for Hillary because they don t really know Bernie Sanders and don t know what he has done for social justice,liberal

At the old age of 61 I am totally embarrassed by what has become of our political system Most of us were brought up being taught that in this country anyone can become President Well I will NEVER EVER tell another one of my students this boldface lie You can only become President if you are rich enough to finance your own campaign and or the party machine will bestow upon you their permission That in addition to the fact that you lose all your rights to free speech when you enter venues which are run by those parties Because it is not a public venue they have the right to silence you Bullshit I am so disgusted A few months ago there was promise hope and the possibility that a movement could change all of this However the process was manipulated and all that faded away The only thing that gives me any pleasure at all is my sincere belief in Karma Oh hark I think I hear the Karma bus coming and it is going to roll a huge lot of individuals over beep beep Wasserman Shultz beep beep ,liberal

The Trumpeteers started off earlier than us and blew the fuse on their own party before Sanders could If Sanders has started assblasting Clinton earlier for the piece of garbage that she is You can bet that Sanders would have been nominated and would be able to take out Trump Let s just be fucking honest with ourselves here if Hillary is nominated Trump s got this election If you think that he could have said anything to end his own campaign then you ve been asleep this past year It ll just take one debate where Trump calls her out on her bullshit and she ll drop like a rock Could Trump have done that to Sanders Nope But the DNC wants their corporate puppet that they manipulate instead of a candidate who would actually win At least Trump will make anime great again I guess I have that to forward too ,liberal

Whoever is on MSNBC right now is actually getting angry with the AP for their decision to call it Nice edit to clarify guys The AP has every right to keep up with the delegate math and yes it is disingenuous to look at Supers the way the MSM is BUT the real problem is that the AP and the MSM feel they need and morally have the right to report on the math knowingly hurting turnout Is the math accurate Yup These Supers have expressed Clinton support Will turnout be hurt tomorrow Yes So fuck em ,liberal
Here s the full statement It is unfortunate that the media in a rush to judgement are ignoring the Democratic National Committee s clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer Secretary Clinton does not have and will not have the requisite number of pledged delegates to secure the nomination She will be dependent on superdelegates who do not vote until July 25 and who can change their minds between now and then They include more than 400 superdelegates who endorsed Secretary Clinton 10 months before the first caucuses and primaries and long before any other candidate was in the race Our job from now until the convention is to convince those superdelegates that Bernie is by far the strongest candidate against Donald Trump ,liberal
TL DR https www reddit com r politics comments 4mwce3 z d3yvb9y Cue the bickering over whether Clinton has now become the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee There is really only one question that need be answered in order to settle this debate What does presumptive nominee mean According to Wikipedia In United States presidential elections the presumptive nominee is a presidential candidate who is assured of his or her party s nomination but has not yet been formally nominated by his or her political party at the party s nominating convention 3 4 Ordinarily a candidate becomes the presumptive nominee of his or her party when his or her last serious challenger drops out 5 or when he or she mathematically clinches whichever comes first But there is still room for interpretation 6 A candidate mathematically clinches a nomination by securing a simple majority i e more than 50 percent of delegates through the primaries and caucuses prior to the convention https en wikipedia org wik,liberal

I m going to get skewered for this but I feel that the claim that the charity misappropriates funds donated to it is unfair most of the Clinton Foundation s charitable works aren t done through cash grants to other charities but through actual charitable work done by employees of the foundation These articles have a good breakdown on their operations http www politifact com punditfact statements 2015 apr 29 rush limbaugh rush limbaugh says clinton foundation spends just http www factcheck org 2015 06 where does clinton foundation money go 6 billion in donations is an order of magnitude off by the way given the source provided in the initial claim http thefederalist com 2015 04 27 in 2013 the clinton foundation only spent 10 percent of its budget on charitable grants ,liberal

The takeway here is this Regardless of who did better in the eyes of those of us who watched the debate thanks to mainstream media reporting on the debate Clinton will be viewed as the overwhelming winner amongst people who didn t watch the debate Edit Social media has given us the unprecedented opportunity to prevent the mainstream media from completely controlling the narrative It is of the utmost importance that we make the best use of it that we can This means not only standing in solidarity for the candidate who actually represents our interests but doing so intelligently and maturely We must be persistent and vigilant in spreading our message but we must also do all we can to genuinely earn the respect of everyone we interact with This does mean at least acknowledging that online polls are less accurate than other methods The media bias in favor of their preferred candidate absolutely stinks but no poll conducted scientifically with an actual random sample is going to show Bernie,liberal
People should just tweet CNN with photos of the poll asking why they got rid of it ,liberal
Meanwhile nearly every other poll online shows Bernie winning by a landslide ,liberal

Not to point fingers here I m just gonna say some facts 1 CNN is owned by Time Warner 2 Time Warner is one of Hillary Clinton s top contributors Time Warned also contributed 50 000 100 000 to the Clinton Foundation Over Clinton s career she has received over 500 000 from Time Warner 3 Clinton has called the TPP a gold standard 4 The TPP has been frowned upon by many Americans because it opposed net neutrality and benefits telecommunications companies Next I ll ask a reflective question because I don t know the answer here With the above information what does Time Warner want from a Clinton presidency The above on the TPP is merely a set of 4 independent facts Take what you will Is there more or just the TPP Money talks Reflect research and report http www politifact com truth o meter statements 2015 oct 13 hillary clinton what hillary clinton really said about tpp and gol http www exposethetpp org TPPImpacts_InternetFreedom html https www opensecrets org politicians contrib php cycle C,liberal
I for one am SHOCKED that CNN would do something like delete a poll that they held that went against their own narrative so heavily This might be me talking crazy but could our media possibly be corrupt and or bias I know it sounds like conspiracy talk but this is just so out of character from the norm that I have to think it may have some credence my sarcasm detector broke ,liberal

If it makes any of you feel better I was not going to vote for Bernie I watched the debate and now I am pledging to his campaign for 12 months ,liberal

This was going to happen with CNN having so much invested in Hilary They will push for the next 2 weeks about how Hilary won and they will slowly fade out the pro Berne material such as the poll What needs to be done by the people is to collect all that material as comes and keep it fresh by repost so it doesn t fade out Screenshots and the like of things like that poll should be constantly circulating the Internet If all it does is show how disgraceful CNN have been that would be a positive step As much as the campaign is funded by money by the people it needs the people to help in its media coverage screen grab video edit and record everything possible to create our own media to counter the very broken CNN and other news corporations ,liberal

I just watched one of the videos where they were fact checking from the debate They asked Bernie if he wanted to shield gun companies from lawsuits His answer was Of course not and continued paraphrasing if they are knowingly doing something illegal they should be prosecuted The CNN voice over then went on to basically say that Bernie is a liar because back in July he said gun manufacturers could not be held responsible nbsp It s clearly evident that Bernie was stating that you can t prosecute gun makers who follow the law but should punish those that do not follow the law Clear and simple but CNN turned it into a Bernie Lie nbsp That s really horrible and annoying that news outlets and I use that term loosely do things like this ,liberal
Did you guys watch the same CNN that I did They actually did a great job showcasing Bernie last night Not only did he get the most camera time he got a long interview immediately after the debate was over Their website may be biased to shit but the actual debate was very fair ,liberal

A reminder to everyone visiting this thread Snopes lists this story as unproven http www snopes com trump raytheon stock and it s unlikely that Trump will have seen a large increase in his own personal value from just this However it s good that we continue to hold Trump accountable That said there are several things you can do right now that help to hold him accountable Phonebank for James Thompson https www grassrootspb com and put someone who opposes actions like these in Congress Get involved with Our Revolution https ourrevolution com Justice Democrats https justicedemocrats com or The Political Revolution r Political_Revolution Get active with the planned marches this month April 15th Tax March http taxmarch org April 22nd March for Science https www marchforscience com April 29th People s Climate March https peoplesclimate org It s important to spread awareness to never lose your sense of outrage and to hold Trump accountable But we can also be productive and try to accomplish s,liberal
Stocks of the military contractor Raytheon surged following the missile attack which used 59 of the company s Tomahawk missiles estimate to cost 1 4 million dollars apiece As stocks surged Raytheon added about a billion dollars to its market value Friday morning According to financial disclosure statements President Trump personally invests in Raytheon meaning he profited directly from the attack Democracy Now https youtu be NsjKLLrhwNc t 208 ,liberal
I m just trying to understand this 1 I didn t realize anyone was able to choose which brand of missile to launch that s a weird concept I assumed they were a utility like which one gets the job done with the best results 2 Are Raytheon missiles a standard or did DJT have to go out of his way to request that these particular missiles were used ,liberal
I mean Raytheon s a large and profitable company I think around the top 100 in the country I d be more surprised if Trump didn t have anything invested in them ,liberal
So I despise trump but this article is bullshit Trump approved an air strike yes but did he say make sure you use them Raytheon cruise missiles he doesn t know what they were going to use ,liberal
This is a pretty shitty article Let s dissect 1 The Wash Post Article did not say that they used the wrong weapon it says why they chose the measly Tomahawk Missle Which was mostly it was the closest ship the cheapest of missles that would not cause much damage but send a message 2 He owns the stock of a very rich military company Im not surprised lol Thats all So he owns a small share in a company that happened to be used during this cold war we have ,liberal
Should be changed to Owned he sold his stocks in Raytheon in June 2016 ,liberal
Stop believing every single shitty headline like this people come on Raytheon is one of the largest weapons manufacturers in the world which the US government contracts It s not a bad investment besides what else would they use He may also share the same molecules with you if you ve been breathing the same atmosphere for long enough does this mean we have to impeach him now ,liberal
Trump ate a hamburger and he has stock in a cheese company PITCHFORKS ,liberal
Lol this is retarded Everyone has invested in raytheon since the iraq war ,liberal
However it s good that we continue to hold Trump accountable By making shit up Trump Drumpf eats babies Am I doing it right ,liberal
Ok so reading this thread it turns out in fact that he no longer does have stock in Raytheon and it is in fact very common to have stock in them So this is a whole big fat nothing burger then ,liberal
Yes The stocked surged a whole 5 From 150 155 ,liberal
Millions of people with a pension will own stocks in Raytheon It s hardly indicative of corruption ,liberal

It s important that criticism is focused on items that are irrefutable Every single one of these fuzzy BS stories that tangentially link some conflict of interest gives Trump the opportunity to create and opposing tweet to distract Articles like this literally build a straw man for him to tear down Up vote the article and you contribute to the problem ,liberal
Let s be real this story isn t a massive bombshell It does fit into the larger picture though that there is little that trump does that does not make him and the rest of the owner class money It s inherent in the way wealth is accumulated and how much it has accumulated in our society Honestly I would be surprised if my IRA wasn t at least partly invested in RTN Do I like it No But I want a cozy retirement more ,liberal

If 20 years down the road you hear about yet another Supreme Court case that didn t go the way you d like don t blame ex President Trump for putting that ultra conservative judge in that seat blame yourself for not voting against him Edit I ve been a Bernie supporter from the beginning but somebody please give me the absolute strongest reason why President Trump would be better for filling a lifetime appointed Supreme Court Justice seat than President Clinton Edit 2 All this quick to anger I ve accepted that this was coming for a while now I get how voting with ideals works but if you were back in 1999 and sick of Al Gore and his accusations of corruption have some fun on google would you still vote Bush or Nader ,liberal

So if this is how bad just the Nevada convention is the national convention is going to be a shitshow of epic proportions The party is not going to come out of it in one piece ,liberal
So what I just got out of that video is that the establlishment held this convention on graduation day from college so the young were automatically excluded Then even so there were more Bernie supporters in line to enter the convention than Hillary supporters Then the preliminary count came down with hundreds more delegates for Hillary than Bernie Then the rules committee wouldn t allow for discussion Can anyone correct or verify if that s the gist of it ,liberal
You know initially I thought I d vote Clinton over Trump because she was not as batshit as Trump I was wrong Hillary Clinton will never be my president ,liberal
i hope Hillary supporters are taking notice right now they think its a conspiracy theory of ours but when this starts happening to them they will realize what we are going through This isnt a Bernie thing this is a democracy issue If we lose fair and square i dont mind but losing even winning through election fraud isnt acceptable ,liberal

My mother is an HRC supporter and she has been so angry about Sanders I finally had to get an answer to why she hates him so much She claims he is a liar because When he first started running for presidency he had no REAL plans on actually becoming PRESIDENT He was just running to open a dialogue and now that he s got a CHANCE he got a big head and now he s ACTUALLY RUNNING How DARE he How dare he actually try to win the presidential race he has been campaigning for When I pointed that out to her you could see the wheels in her head turning as she realized how fucking dumb she sounded Yea someone ran for president with no real hopes of winning and then just because you weren t expecting him to be successful you now want him to drop out so he doesn t threaten to upset the monopoly your candidate it running Wtf is wrong with these people ,liberal

It s a spectrum of tolerance not so much 100 ON OFF so your assumption fails easily before we even get into the logical fallacy you are apparently relying upon When someone goes over the line and seems intent on harming others socially emotionally or physically there s no reason to park our concerns and drop defense of equal rights for those being unilaterally attacked due to some abstract notion of complete tolerance for any and all actions regardless of context In many cases those being attacked are due to issues which are typically non threatening e g skin color religion nationality income level and those types of people deserve overt help from abuses by their would be oppressors whenever possible ,liberal

Clapper shouldn t have much credibility either way he is the one who lied about the NSA ,liberal
Here s a response for people trying to discredit James Clapper Here is the clarification from James Clapper Well it might be useful first to explain the unique position that the FBI occupies in that it straddles both intelligence as a part of the intelligence community and law enforcement My practice during the six and a half years that I was at DNI was always to defer to the director of the FBI be it Director Bob Mueller or Director Jim Comey on whether when and what to tell me about a counterintelligence investigation when the possibility was there that this could devolve into some sort of a criminal investigation So I left it to the judgment of the FBI and that was certainly the practice I followed here But that was consistent with what I did during the whole six and a half years So it s not surprising or out of or abnormal that I would not have known about the investigation or even more importantly the content of that investigation So I don t know if there was collusion or not I do,liberal
Why would Trump say anything about Clapper he s retired from everything afaik Don t see the connection at all Strange lad ,liberal

I think the real issue with politics right now lies with groups of people just like you People who probably have never studied economics history or poli sci beyond the high school level who had little to no interest in politics until the most recent election and who are too proud to admit that they don t understand how the process was set up to work or in fact how it works Regardless of what you believe in politics opinions are like assholes Clinton was the most qualified democrat to run this country You can kick whine moan and bark at the moon over that but it s the absolute truth And I believe anyone who is a true democrat who has followed politics for a decade or longer understand that But people like you who have no concept of why the DNC was formed and what it s main objective is and how they work to achieve that can t see beyond very simple basic ideas The truth is and I realize you do not understand this so I ll be specific Clinton saw how the president operates when her husband,liberal

But is the multitude of anti science members of Congress not reflective of an anti science electorate As a STEM major myself I support getting more scientists into Congress as the next reasonable person but if the people voting don t care about science then I fear this may be a vain effort especially in rural areas ,liberal
A congress of scientists is probably better than what we have but that too would likely create problems I think it s pretty valid that there are people in congress with law backgrounds if they re going to be making laws I think it s valid that there are people in congress with military intelligence backgrounds if they re going to be making decisions about that domain I think it s valid that there are people in congress with business or governmental executive backgrounds In the end we don t want congress dominated by any one background We want a congress with a very diverse intellectual background so that collectively they can understand a very diverse amount of problems and populations ,liberal

That same electorate is also generally against very wealthy people who screw over the middle class and the poor but often proceed to elect wealthy people who screw over the middle class and the poor The point being that we can definitely convince an anti science electorate to elect scientists if we sing the right tunes ,liberal
I m just more supportive of getting people in Congress who understand science and who are open minded enough to believe the research and the opinions of experts throughout different fields Just because someone is a scientist doesn t mean they are necessarily fit to be a Congressman or a governing figure ,liberal

Interesting question since the Department of Education has been gutted by ESSA It s still supposed to put pressure on the states to maintain accountability for schools and ensure that federal funds for education are spent appropriately DeVos is not only completely unqualified to do this but her disdain for the public school system means federal funding is more likely to be misappropriated under her guidance Also when someone is interviewing for a position if you have to ask What harm could this applicant do it s the wrong person Most employees are expected to actually perform some upside rather than just to do no harm and collect a paycheck ,liberal
Yes states basically set all education spending and goals Department of Education can direct some spending to states but a lot of it is based on legislation which DeVos can t really do much about She ll work on promoting Charter Schools which aren t exactly unpopular among Democrats Ultimately this was the unions asking Dems to die on a weird hill ,liberal

I am torn I have health insurance that I pay about 230 a month for I m single childless and healthy It s nice to know I wouldn t go bankrupt if I ended up in a hospital but the deductible is so high that I wouldn t even be able to pay that So losing it would not be such a blow at least for me I wouldn t mind a switch to a single payer system but I am not sure the halfway measure that was ACA is really worth defending ,liberal
I notice everyone in here is talking about people who are going to lose marketplace insurance which I agree is a serious problem However there s something equally important that we need to talk about the defunding of Medicaid Between 69 and 81 million Americans about half of them children rely on Medicaid and CHIP for health insurance I am one of them All of us are poor and many of us are disabled And our lives are in danger When the ACA is repealed the Medicaid expansion will be repealed with it The report estimates what would happen in a hypothetical state with 300 000 people in the individual market that has also expanded Medicaid In the individual market enrollment would fall 30 percent and 90 000 people would become uninsured An additional 115 000 people in that hypothetical state may also lose coverage because they are enrolled in Medicaid and cannot find an affordable private plan 32 states have expanded Medicaid Using these hypothetical numbers which won t be accurate of course,liberal
Everytime a state seriously explores single payer healthcare it gets shot down when people see the costs We need one solid blue state just one solid blue state to pass a bill that mandates companies print on their employees pay stubs the amount that the company either is or would be spending towards providing the employee affordable single person insurance If in just one solid blue state everyone saw how much money that s part of their total compensation gets put towards health insurance and then they saw what the cost of statewide single payer would be then that state would be so much more likely to implement a single payer system ,liberal

This issue should bring the country to the brink of civil war let it be in the form of nonviolence and should show the Republicans to be on par with the Confederates of the Civil War Plain and simple This article does not take the final step and ask How many will die Why is that ,liberal
Sure That s the urgent thing and should not be totally ignored My comment may have been a bit hasty However the reason we are in this bind is due to the overwhelming power of these companies They should not be part of the universal healthcare conversation go forward ,liberal
People will die but as long as rich people get to pay less taxes then fuck em Obviously s ,liberal
The moment republicans sign this fully repeal Obamacare and give the proper replacement and leave millions without healthcare they will def feel it in midterms ,liberal

Or Donald Trump s signature DonTcare ,liberal
Gotta disagree with you there because you re overlooking something with a huge impact the GOP plan to repeal the Medicaid expansion and turn it into a block grant program 72 5 million nearly 1 in 4 Americans rely on Medicaid and CHIP for health insurance all of whom are poor and many of whom are disabled About half are children And cutting funding to Medicaid is very very likely to kill millions of them Can we talk about that for a minute ,liberal
Huh ,liberal
That s one of the main reasons they want to repeal it Obamacare just strengthened the insurance companies and with that you can bet the market costs of health services would skyrocket The market needs to be addressed not just throw money at the insurance companies ,liberal
BUT BUT BUT they re so pro life ,liberal
I m in the same place as you health financial wise but to me what it comes down to is protecting those with pre existing conditions Remove the ACA and all of a sudden they either can t get or can t afford the medicine they need to survive day to day I don t mind that it costs me something extra Is the ACA ideal Nope But if it s going to be repealed they should actually have something better ready and not just repeal it as a political move ,liberal
Look at the ACA as a starting point toward single payer not the end of the process ,liberal

I have French friends and have been to France a few times From discussions with them it seems to me that one of the biggest problems France has is how difficult it is for companies to reduce staff Because of this they are extremely nervous about hiring and this leads to high unemployment Macron has said that he intends to loosen up employment law If he does it right by providing an adequate safety net for those who do lose their jobs it could really help the French economy and reduce social unrest by providing employment to groups that currently are suffering higher than average unemployment From what I have seen of his policy statements I am hopeful ,liberal

Personally I believe getting rid of Donald Trump even if it were possible which it isn t at present would be a terrible tactical mistake Yes he s horrible and an international and domestic embarrassment But he s also ineffective and limiting the effectiveness of Congress also because they re spending all sorts of time responding to the latest outrage or tweet or whatever Plus Trump is so outrageous that Dems and independents will unify to oust him and statehouse congressional Republicans that support him in 2018 2020 which is crucial for redistricting and the judiciary By contrast president Pence would be just as terrible policy wise but actually more effective at implementing it and in more palatable terms We lose momentum and outrage and peoole who right now resist Trump for non policy reasons but might support a more statesmanlike president The next few years will suck hard Those of us who didn t vote for Trump many of us saw this coming But I think the next fifty years will be bett,liberal

Many whites conveniently forget Obama is half white and the only parent he was close to was his white mother whom he loved dearly He very much embraces his mother s heritage too and is decidedly not anti white ,liberal
Many white people Yeah racist assholes that want to be the dominant race Obama flies in the face of their beliefs ,liberal

Yes and it s not for you It s for his followers He is feeding their victim complex to increase his support Be wary of these sorts of tactics Fact checking him does zero his supporters aren t listening to anyone but him ,liberal
It is odd that Fox News is willing to go to such lengths to keep the truth from America Partisanship is one thing but treason is a bit too far They re in a position to open people s eyes to the mistake they made last year ,liberal

This is the one talent he has finding someone or something to blame I bet he will still be blaming others in 2020 ,liberal
It s hard to know what to do in fact when he has their full trust and he casts us as villains ,liberal
His supporters don t care about anyone except their own loyalty or pacifying antifascist and resistance movements that make safe activism possible We need to fight their pseudo intellectualism ,liberal
A whole year ,liberal
First realize that you can t change that casting Focus your energy on getting out the vote from reachable reasonable people who generally don t bother to vote instead of trying to change the mind of someone who is utterly unmovable Protest donate to orgs that are fighting for change vote get out the vote volunteer contact representatives do all you can but don t waste your time and breath trying to change the minds of those who refuse to even hear you ,liberal
He pretty much has the Media is the enemy of the people and talking to any trump supporters if you criticize any aspect of him they ll label you a liberal and ignore everything you have to say ,liberal
To whom though To the uninformed and the fence sitters Sure To trump s supporters They already know They re not wrong they re lying There s a difference Trump didnt claim Obama wiretapped him because he doesn t know it s untrue he lied to distract you from his own crimes His supporters know Hillary wasn t corrupt Trump is corrupt They love him Corruption doesnt bother them They know everything they say to you is bullshit It s just lies to try and win the argument You won t reach them with facts ,liberal
Other than the ACLU which I already donate to what are good organizations out there ,liberal
But but but Damn it you re right ,liberal
Of course I m not saying we use facts of course we do but that s besides the point we don t need facts We need to get out the vote and rebuild our tattered and broken coalition If we loose state legislation we risk the very real possibility of the Republicans being able to amend the constitution We need a unifying message and we need one from the people that isn t from outsiders or wealthy business men We need one from the people of the party A message that represents everyone not a select few To do that you need to fight their pseudo intellectualism within our own ranks We need to prevent our party from bleeding more or let this party die and form a new one It s not to educate them it s to educate our own We are just as guilty as promoting this insanity based off of some alternate reality which we as Democrats like to live in We need to recognize our majority and use that ,liberal
I am beginning to think there aren t any real fence sitters left ,liberal
Honestly talking to some of his supporters even friends of mine I feel like they are brainwashed I don t know fully where they get their info if i had to guess itd be from echochambering on FB but they parrot Trump s talking points all the time ,liberal

It s awful but it s true It s our inclination to educate but you cannot educate the unwilling If we want to survive we need to educate those who have not already abandoned reason for conservatism and increase our support But the more we wrangle with the right the more they keep standing still just arguing ,liberal
See the problem I have is this oft repeated message It comes in many forms but it s always the same notion the Dems ignored people We never ever did Obama didn t fix Bush s crashed economy only for gays and blacks Obama didn t push hard to create jobs for 8 years only for rich elites You know who ignored them The GOP that blocked every jobs infrastructure and economic repair bill that crossed their desks for 8 years so they could win elections They forgot the working class not the lone democrat in power for the last 6 years But you re right the tact we have to take with Republican voters is very different They won this election by spreading fake news and lies and bullying and witch hunts and hacking and name calling Talking sense them to won t work ,liberal
When they deflect wrong doing by trying to point out someone else did something similar the thing to do is say okay let s investigate them too I have no problem with that America has to wise up and not be fooled and distracted by these childish tactics This is grade school stuff ,liberal
I didn t mean to come off that we ignored people you put that better than I did but new tactics are needed to fight this fake religion of pseudo intellectualism Agreed ,liberal
My fear is that the best choice is to fight fire with fire I don t want us to become that but we may have to ,liberal
It will be bad for a few years but the fight as always is within our own coalition We waste time by spreading our message to the Republicans that s why they won and we didn t we tried to play the middle ground to much ,liberal
That I completely agree with but with some provisos It s not that we usually have a rift within the coalition We generally have been fine This election was different though I have never witnessed so large a chunk of the Democratic youth vote just refuse to vote for the democrat when SO much was on the line I get that they wanted Sanders so did I but I didn t lose my mind and throw the nation to the worst collection of corrupt Republicans I have personally witnessed I m not sure how you fix that The only answer seems to be run a far left candidate but A none seem to have emerged and B then you d alienate the other half of the party who want liberalism but not blatant socialism We also have to realize that there were literally buildings of paid shills on the internet sowing dissent on purpose How do you unite the party when people posing as members of the party stir up crazy nonsense I really think the best way to convince the public from any party is to do nothing right now but let Trum,liberal
And then loses it because the Russian press publishes a picture of the meeting ,liberal
Colin H Kahl the former national security adviser to Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr took to Twitter to pose what he called a deadly serious question Was it a good idea to let a Russian gov photographer all their equipment into the Oval Office David S Cohen the former deputy director of the C I A during the Obama administration responded No it was not ,liberal
Our NSA director also wasn t consulted on such a meeting as revealed in the senate hearing that happened today My mind boggles ,liberal
America First hahah ,liberal
They thought it was Lavrov or Kislyak s personal photographer not a photographer working for TASS So in fairness they were trying to keep all press out of the meeting Through lack of planning and procedure they essentially got punkd and had a minor security issue at the same time ,liberal
The title should read Putin bars U S press ,liberal
This is beyond the pale Or orange I guess ,liberal
According to NPR they thought it was Russia s official photographer not a press photographer White House photographer was present too But sure let s spear click bait ,liberal
Does anyone else think that this is bullshit set up scenario Seriously this is fake ass news at it s best ,liberal
They tricked us an angry White House official said That s the problem with the Russians they lie the official added It s like Nobody knew healthcare was so complicated ,liberal
Those Russians ain t loyal Something Trump learned only just yesterday ,liberal
But nothing this administration does is a good idea to say the least ,liberal
When the former Deputy Director of the CIA says it was a bad idea to let a Russian photographer into the Oval Office it s more than a minor security issue It continues to be amateur hour at the White House ,liberal
I don t think a random bunch of people walk in without an invite to the white house and without the security services knowing who they are But what do I know ,liberal
Wait so its ok that they don t know who is coming into the white house Did you not see air force one Because not knowing what Russian dudes you have near the president is pretty fucking bad So are they dumb or incompetent ,liberal
Yeah a few problems with that 1 the state photographer and press photographer could be the same since the state owns the press that it was released by 2 the allowing of the Russian government photographer into a closed meeting raises security concerns ,liberal
Huh You mean the photograph is fake ,liberal
I thought that was a clever but made up quote but nope it s actually fucking real lmao ,liberal
They are such meanies ,liberal
Exactly Minor security issue ,liberal
I agree but the narrative has been that the Russian press was allowed in while the US press was not The intent was to have no press in the room not to allow Russian press and not US press I think it s an important point The seeming ineptitude in handling who has access to the president is a whole nother thing ,liberal
White House photographer was there too ,liberal
Here s a question Why is the President having undisclosed closed door meetings with Lavrov and Kislyak ,liberal
What does that have to do with any of those points ,liberal
1 They were disclosed there was just supposed to be no press present 1a Presidents have closed door meetings with people all the time 1b The optics I m not crazy about that term being in the lexicon of doing so now is as has been mentioned above amateur hour 2 Because Pootie Poot asked him to 2a See 1b PS Formatting sucks since I don t quite understand the reddit markup ,liberal
Great Thanks Joe To bad your show gave him a recurring platform to get his message out and you tried to briefly make nice before the election with Trump ,liberal

This warms my heart to see democrats actually becoming active again in Ky It has gotten so bad that most dems almost feel the need to run and hide while the debris and fallout from the state turning republican falls all around us it is a scary time to be a democrat in Kentucky politics and i m just so hopeful this is leading to a real revolution well hopeful may be too strong a word ,liberal

At least they got to meet Yarmuth ,liberal
So are they going to vote him out or be deeply offended by the opposition wanting to let women choose how they live Too many people see the government wasting money on contraceptives as being far worse than building a fucking wall ,liberal
While I commend them it will mean nothing if they can t get people to vote him out I can do Mahoney him being smug thinking he s just fine as long as he continues to be elected We really need to capitalize on this energy to get them to vote ,liberal
So like I know that Mitch McConnell is a piece of shit and everything but waylaying him when he flies home then showing up at his house is fucking creepy Not sure what this sub s stance on doxxing is but this is just like that A person should be able to feel secure in their own home full stop If his constituents didn t like him so much they shouldn t have voted him in for the fifth time This is a democracy We get the representatives we vote for I don t like this administration any more than any of y all but cheering on people who are actively threatening a man in his own home is just despicable ,liberal

I do believe that there were some doing this in 2009 It s major deja vu Democrat strategists were convinced the protestors were being paid by the Koch brothers and that the tea party wasn t a real movement Now you see republicans doing the same thing It s all feels so crazy to me ,liberal
Dunno about running and hiding but you could definitely accuse a number of Democrats as being spineless Both present day and in the past ,liberal
Although it will not happen under a Rep Congress we need campaign financing reform In Tennessee state legislators make 20 000 approx base per diem and the average cost to run a campaign is 150 000 This is absurd I would have to raise 3 times my salary for a job that pays 40 of my current salary If I were to run as a Democrat here in East Tenn it is almost a certain loss Redistricting ending gerrymandering and campaign finance reform are necessities if we want fair and democratic voting in our republic ,liberal
Public figure accepts job as public employee representing the interest and will of the people There should be no expectation of nicety these are public spaces ,liberal
He has no expectation of privacy As long as the people aren t trespassing this is fair game ,liberal

This could totally work but I don t know This would be fighting in trump s comfort zone To beat trump at this game would require an all in strategy and trump has no qualms about fighting dirty For it to work Obama would likely have to sink to trump s level which would mostly just look bad on Obama I like the idea to fight trump on twitter but we need someone that we are ok with if they get a little dirty ,liberal

Shortly after trump s election I participated in a huge conference call Obama held with former campaign staffers He promised that after a well earned vacation he would jump back into the fight I hope and trust that he will keep his promise ,liberal

Jon Stewart Satire is the best foil to his style IMHO ,liberal

The dirtier he fights the filthier he looks No one said McFaul has to attack trump with dirty tactics and if Trump does then he s the one who looks to coin a phrase SAD ,liberal
By saying nothing he s defeating Trump at his own game The second he says anything at all Trump wins ,liberal
He doesn t need to fight or talk to Trump at all He just needs to use his platform to mobilize and bring a call to action to his followers That s all ,liberal
I m one of them Makes it better to know his followers aren t all true ones I doubt Obama haters follow him for similar reasons since Obama doesn t act like a fucking baby in front of millions of people 24 7 ,liberal

Can t verify the story but doing a reverse image search showed this as original ,liberal
Putting aside for a minute that I completely disagree with trump about this it was a HUGE miscalculation for him to involve himself in this to the degree he did Now kneeling is the unofficial fuck you trump signal Even people who didn t support the initial protest and the cause it was addressing now support the players kneeling because it went from a controversial BLM thing to a the president is attacking free speech issue which is less controversial And since he can t actually stop them he looks foolish and weak whenever people kneel now since he made such a big deal out of it This guy has no strategy sense This could ONLY hurt trump ,liberal

There s no reason to vilify but there s not much power in this one for me He s anonymous so his gesture is without context and fails to communicate intent Maybe he was kneeling out of respect who knows If he had someone go jam a microphone in his face immediately after and ask him what he was about maybe it would mean something specific to anyone but himself but I m looking at a still picture here ,liberal

Then dont be disingenuous and claim it is all about police brutality of which you make no unified statement as to changes that need to happen to end the protesting which you know is kind of the point of protest As soon as trump tweeted about it everyone piggybacked on it as an FU to Trump and when people say its disrespectful they get oh youre not against police brutality you racist piece of shit Call it what it is instead of being cowards I think trump is a jackass btw but im not blinded to the reality of whats going on by hate ,liberal
Lol yes I m sure you re frothing at the mouth over semantics not race or anything ,liberal
Calling people racist when there is no evidence of such is an ad hominem atrack and implies you have no argument What do the players want specifically to happen to stop protesting Do you know It cant sinply be for police brutality to end because There is no way to know if an incident of police brutality may happen say 20 days or 20 years from now So are they just going to protest until tbey retire Have they announced a list of specific steps Are you just going to call me a racist again without answering my question Perhaps ignore it because you dont know the answer Maybe a down vote to try and bury me calling you out for your ignorance Inquiring minds want to know ,liberal

Even sadder to me was how we all seemed to rally behind a woman because of that fact alone Do you really believe that is the only reason people rallied behind Clinton I am reminded of something Chris Rock said when asked about Obama Running in 2008 A host asked him if he was happy about a Black man running for President Chris Rock said I am happy this black man is running for President You know I m not going to vote for Flavor Flav Chris Rock was saying that Obama was a good candidate and him being black was a bonus He wasn t going to vote for just any black guy Hillary was a good candidate it was just a bonus she was a woman A nice change of pace and a symbol of progress But it wasn t just because she was a woman It s because she was a qualified women I notice a lot of your Bernie supporters always reduce Clinton Supporters to You have to vote for the vagina and after all it s her turn in sort of a sneering condescending way Isn t it possible that Clinton supporters liked her because ,liberal

I live in a red state and several facebook friends have been posting about how the liberals are all using Irma as proof that global warming is real But I am having trouble finding anyone who actually has said this The best someone could do was Bill Nye who I think its a great introductory science educator for kids and layman but is not a climate change authority or expert His degree is in mechanical engineering Not that theres anything wrong with that You dont have to be a scientist to be a science teacher Just like your high school science teacher probably wasnt Anyways I am not sure where the right is getting this idea that democrats want to use Irma as the smoking gun proof of man made climate change This doesnt appear to be a mainstream view of the democratic party The storm hasnt even hit landfall yet It would be premature to say anything at this point I am not even sure how you would go about proving absolutely that Irma exists due to global warming But then again I m not an expe,liberal

Step one Create a fictitious and irrational fear Step two Discredit the news organizations that disagree with your fictional events Step three Enjoy your Authoritarian regime ,liberal
A big part of this is to discredit the news media Haven t heard of these terrorist attacks That s because the media is hiding the real news from you as well creating Fake News stories about the president They have lost all credibility and aren t to be trusted Before long a significant portion of the population with poor critical thinking and analysis skills don t know own what to believe so they believe those who are in authority When the authorities get close to a losing election they can claim voter fraud amd a non existent terrorist attack and decide to impose martial law suspend the Constitution and suspend elections until things are under control and enough of the population will go along with it to make it stick Then when they start detaining opposition voices nobody will believe the new media when they try to expose it We are on the first steps of a very dark path ,liberal

After so many it is gas lighting the public ,liberal
Meanwhile no mention of the actual attacks or planned attacks from home grown white Christian terrorists right here in the U S It s astounding that people are leaping to discrimination against fictitious events while ignoring real shooting and planned violence as it actually happens Guy gets arrested in Myrtle Beach for planning a racial terrorist shooting attack Not a peep I m absolutely not equating Christians with terrorists but if we are going to actually combat terrorism in the US we should start where it s actually happening There s no need to invent attacks when there are plenty of people being attacked in the US for real You want to stop terror attacks Start with the terrorist groups like the KKK that are already in the United States ,liberal

The Swedish one is total bullshit He said there was an incident not a terror attack An incident can mean a lot of things not just a terror attack Stop putting words in people s mouths ,liberal

Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley has been holding a talking filibuster on the Senate floor for the past thirteen fourteen fifteen hours in protest of the Gorsuch nomination http www huffingtonpost com entry jeff merkley senate protest_us_58e466f8e4b03a26a367750d jp4467aqz61zfflxr He started talking 7pm on April 4th he s still talking at 8 40am 9 40am 10 15am April 5th In the past quarter century only one Senator has spoken longer and that s Ted Cruz who spent twenty one hours filibustering Obamacare by reading Doctor Suess and talking about Duck Dynasty which is to say some historians don t think it counts http www nydailynews com news politics ted cruz filibuster talks 21 hours votes house bill article 1 1467344 Update And he s done He spoke for fifteen fucking hours This dude is a badass If you re in his district or his state I highly recommend you call and offer your support and thanks for this man s awesome patriotism Reminder There are nine special elections being held in the month,liberal

I ve been watching the Supreme Court saga but I haven t really looked into Gorsuch that much What are the arguments against him ,liberal
I like how the GOP is all if you let us have this one we ll work with you on the next one For realsies The Dem s have been pushed around pretty hard the past eight years The only response they should have is go fuck yourself ,liberal
removed ,liberal
The first problem is that for the first problem in history we are considering a nominee for a stolen Supreme Court seat The second problem is that there is an investigation into collusion between the President and Russia Finally this is an extreme nominee from the far right His closing argument summed it up ,liberal
I voted for him We are super proud of both our Senators here in Oregon they re doing amazing work Ron Wyden is killing it on the intelligence committee ,liberal
I m Canadian How does the filibuster thing work What happens if he keeps on going or stops ,liberal
Actually he and his ill are the reason the filibuster will die Stupid partisan Advice and consent does NOT mean you get to pile on with liberal litmus tests Gorsuch is eminently qualified and will be confirmed ,liberal
I m sick of politics or vying for political points on both sides of the aisle Gorsuch seems like a good man and would be a good judge Let him be nominated ,liberal
I watched as Gorsuch was questioned and I honestly can say I don t think I would feel bad with him on the Supreme Court I am a democrat but he seemed quite honest that he follows precedent and will follow the law If he ends up being a liar about it he sure fooled me ,liberal
Ya ll know McConnell is just gonna change the rules right Then any party with control of the senate will be able to just walk their pick onto the bench Like I appreciate the effort and the thought and I also realize how fucked up the entire situation i but Gorsuch is going to be seated filibuster or not ,liberal

If joining the resistance means mindlessly opposing everything Trump does including this good nomination then I don t want to join this This is getting ridiculous I ll gladly join you to oppose building a racist gimmick waste of money wall I ll gladly join you to oppose the banning of anyone temporary or not I ll gladly scold Trump for saying something stupid But it sounds like the resistance is an undemocratic hate group hellbent on opposing Trump even if he nominated jesus christ or cured cancer This isn t right Are there any resistance troopers here that agree with what I m saying Are you seeing an excessive amount of radical leftists joining the resistance Or maybe I m misunderstanding the resistance as a whole ,liberal

About that swamp draining Has anyone ever asked Trump for a definition of those terms What does he think the swamp is exactly What is it to be drained of I have come to the conclusion that we have all misinterpreted his statement The swamp is the Federal government itself He is draining it of all power to do the jobs it was intended to do Trump and the Republicans are anti Federalists They are trying to gut the entire Federal government and go back as far as they can to state rights We need to learn our history We need to see why the federal government has had to take on jobs it has been doing or we will return to the days when America had far less influence in the world and far fewer protections for the average citizen Unfortunately for us the rest of the world is not going back in time We will be in an awful position if they succeed and they are already succeeding ,liberal
It s shocking that they keep letting him do shit like this without repercussions Does the president really have this much power to run what I thought was a democratic government like a dictator ,liberal
I very much suspect that Trump s ethics executive order either is not understood within the administration and not enforced or the White House counsel is single handedly interpreting the restrictions of the executive order so narrowly that they are next to meaningless said Craig Holman of the watchdog group Public Citizen This is why the Democrats laughed during the Joint Address when Trump said he was draining the swamp https www theguardian com us news video 2017 mar 01 democrats laugh donald trump draining swamp congress video ,liberal

Keep in mind Trump is not the last president Future presidents do not need to be set up with this much power either ,liberal

How is it to bear arms is a right when healthcare is a privilege ,liberal
The conservatives viewpoint The free market if left to its own devices and not manipulated by the government would have incentivived all these victims every single one of them to have health insurance from really good companies that would have taken excellent care of them in their time of need And if someone was so stupid to not have health insurance that person obviously deserves to suffer and to go untreated or cared for Oh and his family and friends and loved ones also deserve all the accompanying grief and to go bankrupt trying to get him the necessary medical attention he needs It s so simple and beautiful and fair s ,liberal

Sort of relatedly gun liability insurance could be a good way to address guns violence in the US It s at least worth some thought The idea is to treat guns as a strict liability if you own a gun you are liable for any damage caused by that gun You are also required to have liability insurance just like you are with a car So ultimately the insurance company will have to pay for damages again like with cars Certain types of weapons and certain types of people would be uninsurable If you can t get insurance you can t own the weapon Right now the cost of gun ownership in the USA is socialized Required gun liability insurance would privatize the cost of gun ownership shifting it to gun owners and use the free market to correctly price risk It s a system that would scale well and evolve quickly Insurance companies would have a long term relationship with the insured rather than a point in time relationship during a single transaction Obviously criminals would not bother with purchasing insur,liberal

Find me The right to wear shoes on a plane shall not be infringed in the Bill of Rights and we can make this comparison There are countries with strict gun laws who have low murder rates There are countries that forbid guns where you can get decapitated by a chainsaw for walking down the street at the wrong time and seeing the wrong thing Let s stop pretending there is some binary switch tethered to gun ownership that will somehow determine level of violence and let s start looking at the cause of violent behavior Hell let s start with the media and their wanton glorification of mass violence and those who perpetuate it ,liberal

Note how the FCC is only investigating those comments because they are critical of Trump If Colbert said that about a different politician that didn t have thin skin nothing would have happened ,liberal
Trump seems to not realize that reacting wildly to people with dissenting views will essentially just draw more attention to those opinions ,liberal
Just because people here are all over the topic today the FCC legally has to review complaints that come in That s literally what they re there for Write one yourself even make shit up and they ll investigate I ve worked with them under both Democratic and Republican administrations they actually fucking hate this kind of political complaint thing The actual FCC story here is that Trumpster fires have no problem trying to enact actual censorship when their widdle fee fees get hurt They re just kinda fucking stupid which is why they think an FCC complaint means anything Colbert s not going anywhere this was after 10PM EDIT For those wondering why the air time matters FCC standards are much looser for shows that air after 10PM They d have to prove it wasn t an attempt at political statement or artistic decision if they wanted to do anything to him Obscenity is a really high bar to clear which is why you don t see it often ,liberal

I love how Trump supporters just accidentally became SJWs Someone should tell them about the cancelcolbert campaign from back in 2014 They re on those guys side now I don t get why Trump supporters are acting like Colbert was always some kind of extreme left SJW type person He never was he was always a comedian first and rarely gives two shits about people s sensitivities towards jokes Literally 2 minutes before the cock holster joke Colbert called Kim Jong Un a fat little man 2 days before that he likened Trump comparing his ratings to 9 11 to saying our ratings are sinking faster than the Titanic they re blowing up like Hiroshima And when the audience hissed at the Hiroshima joke he said oh but the Titanic joke was fine People need to actually watch the guys show before they make all these assumptions about him He s just a very funny comedian and sometimes that involves offending sensitive people ,liberal

IT IS TIME FOR COLBERT TO GET OFF TV FOR GOOD And run for president He would be hands down Trump s worst nightmare He d shred Trump s every comment and alarmist fake news declaration And just imagine the debates He s a hundred times smarter than Trump super far more comfortable on TV and under pressure than Clinton ever was and his ratings are better ,liberal

I ve never bought Reddit gold Why the fuck would you buy Reddit gold ,liberal
Yes we want freedom of speech But if 100 nazi s wanted to come into your house for a meeting in your house made memes used your wifi spread those horrible memes to make 1 000 000 nazi s would you let them Nope So please kick t_d out Or just simply change their rules to be MORE like reddit where they have to let EVERYONE up DOWN DOWN DOWN vote their stuff They shouldn t be given a safe bubble zone where sane people can t counter their hate speech with sane speech For those willful idiots who can t see I m not saying this is MY house I m saying that the owners of Reddit Conde Nast own this house Would they really want to give safe haven to racists I m calling the owners of this platform to alter the rules so that awful speech can be countered by sane speech THAT is what the founders of the USA envisioned That good speech would outweigh bad speech Reddits current sub rules do not allow for that balance instead create bubbles of hate ,liberal
I wasn t buying it anyways ,liberal
I m not sure what banning T_D would accomplish apart from reinforcing their victim complex and feeding their message about leftist fascism Edit Thanks for the gold On another note I m disappointed in some of your comments for what seems to be an utter lack of commitment to liberal ideals Many of our ancestors and every generation since have fought to preserve the egalitarian and tolerant principles of a free society including the right to oppose that freedom Not just our nation but all free nations maintain liberty through our collective and individual commitment to free speech not by silencing those that hate free speech but by letting TRUTH speak for itself and fight its own battles By trying to ban The_Donald you are no better than The_Donald This is bigger than any injuries or harm done by hate speech This is about building a society that is better than the one The_Donald wants to build ,liberal

Everyone should find a good ad blocker and block all of reddit s ads as well I mean they should do that anyway but definitely do it till r the_douchenuckles gets shut down ,liberal
I hate that subreddit as much as the next but I ll never get on board with the mass silencing of a group of people no matter how shitty they are ,liberal
Probably gonna be in the minority on this but I think trying to get a subreddit taken down for political reasons even if it really is in violation of reddit s terms of service is basically just mob censorship ,liberal
Typical liberal narrative Can t win by debating so trying to shut down and silence like usual Yawn ,liberal
Let s censor all who disagree with us will not improve the situation If we got together and actually talked about issues without resorting to violence maybe then we could stop the rise of extremists on both sides The problem is this is the inevitable response to the extremists from one side or did we all forget the Antifa punch a Nazi which basically labeled all on the right as Nazis The blame for the political division falls on both sides and now lives have been lost because of it ,liberal
No I support free speech I also support discussion amidst political disagreements Neither of which is your proposal Instead you would shut down opposition Even then your method of protest a boycott of reddit gold while using reddit A platform that fosters hundreds of thousands of communities a few of which do not get along Your proposal for Reddit to shut down T_D is on par with you leaving Reddit Both accomplishes the same goal for you and that is that you don t have to see T_D But you re not leaving Why Because you have something to say Sure OK I can dig it And so do they And they aren t leaving either Disagree all you like That s cool Don t get along Sure But don t help to degrade the freedom of speech And yes I fully understand that Reddit is not a government agency and therefore can set it s own rules Simply put don t be that which you are fighting against ,liberal
How about someone starts a subreddit that brings Reddit s advertisers to the front page at a rate of about one per day urging users to boycott these companies I think that would be the most effective measure ,liberal
The Admins give you guys a safe place to plan your fake activism and cyber attacks and they give the same leeway to T_D SRS Politics Worldnews etc Nothing that happens on Reddit is important get over it and stop thinking the Admins are here to help you They are to hear to generate ad revenue from user traffic which is made up of all the stupid teams that have formed on Reddit You idiots are the product not the consumer The Admins are not going to ban or shut down anything This site always has and always will thrive on controversy and bitching about it just makes it more so ,liberal

While this new plan is not ideal and I don t want it to pass I must say that my own coverage became completely unaffordable with the ACA through my employer coverage and has stopped me from taking myself and my daughters to the doctor and even cutting back on daily prescriptions to the detriment of my career I m considered middle class So yes the ACA was is a disaster for me and MANY of my friends and needs to change ,liberal
Blame them all Call it Republicare ,liberal
Why can t I find any information about TN reps Is there a complete list somewhere ,liberal
I thought people were supposed to call it republicare ,liberal

Woah really It would be a bad health care thing Woah I did nooot expect this at all Whooo go America Europe sucks right High taxes and shit Our healthcare is also sooooo bad ,liberal
Alert Trumpcare is horrible and it affects everyone even those with healthcare through employers Today might be the day of reckoning where the House either kills the bill or gets enough votes to head to Senate Call your Reps and tell them NO WE DON T WANT THIS When I clicked the link I was hoping to find some bullet points as to how specifically Trumpcare hurts everyone affects everyone affectation may not necessarily be bad is horrible how is it horrible You did not explain it You expect me to panic and call as an knee jerk impulse Most people are more level headed than that The content of the webpage is great as it gives me a ready to go contact info but If we wanna get people on our team we gotta be better at informing people as to why they should be contacting their reps ,liberal
In all likelihood the only people who ll be affected negatively affected are those with a history of health issues Trumps proposed alterations to the ACA would allow for individuals to be charged different rates based on their rate of utilization of said insurance You know like every other insurance in the world ,liberal
Hello I have a question How would Trumpcare impact me I have a pre existing condition that requires frequent operations that I will require for the rest of my life If this passes could my insurer charge me double or triple of what someone else would pay for the same coverage If so I would really fucking hate that It s incredibly easy to vote yes on Trumpcare when you re not part of the group that will suffer because of it ,liberal
What if I want it ,liberal
I like his plan My family s premiums are absurd this year ,liberal
Er what about the current healthcare system where premiums are sky rocketing and single insurers are gaining monopolies over entire states IE crony capitalism Meanwhile small businesses are being strangled by increased costs and we all get the same level of coverage often worse coverage than we did before This subreddit will go out of its way to support increased taxes regulations and crony capitalism at the expense of everyone else simply because you are pure partisans When did it become cool to resist change and keep taxes and costs high on yourself ,liberal

What kind of ridiculous shapes will the GOP fold themselves in to spin this bullshit ,liberal
The the real story is the leakers crap is getting old Maybe you shouldn t have used the leaks from the Clinton campaign against them so much if you thought it was unfair Mr Trump ,liberal
Could there possibly be a better example of how utterly incompetent and disconnected from reality Trump is He really couldn t have been further from the mark about the consequences of his actions ,liberal
1 Calling Comey a Nut Job is clear projection Anyone that has half a brain can see who the real nut job is And yet here we are with Republicans trying to keep this guy in office in order to put thier agenda ahead of their country That truelly is the sad part 2 This is Obstruction of Justice This is the main take away from the NY Times article If it s true then it means that trump explained to the Russians that he thought firing Comey would slow stall or out right stop the Russian investigation There s no way anyone can see this as being anything less than Obstruction of Justice 3 The white house isn t refuting that this happened LOL They are so fucked ,liberal
The fact that he s still not shutting his mouth really only leaves my logic with a couple theories the most likely of which is that trump knows his ass is grass so he will continue to complain and undermine our laws and law enforcement agencies until he gets close to indictment at which point he will resign and blame it on this witch hunt He s not a sophisticated person by any means and this act would be the grand finale of his incompetently transparent presidency ,liberal
Sometimes I am dumbfounded at how stupid this man is But at this point I just don t know what else could shock me ,liberal
So once everything is out in the open people resign some are convicted some pardoned and the dust settled how do we go about restoring some confidence in our government and and its processes ,liberal
I am dumbfounded of the complete ignorance of his followers Just today a tea partier posted on FB Sacrificed his billionaire life to save America SMH ,liberal
removed ,liberal
So when Trump gets thrown out office which seems almost sure to happen at this point what happens then He s pooped out a lot of horrible policy appointed people into positions of power should that remain in effect The Republicans took power through treason do they get to keep it If so why Can the people not demand another election That the whole system be reformed Is it not a citizen s duty explicitly stated in the Constitution to replace a government that s not serving its people Don t stop at Trump ,liberal
Just when you think things can t get any crazier ,liberal
Fucking hell it s hard to believe that even he would say something so self incriminating out loud I wonder if he talked to the russians about grabbing some more pussies while he was at it ,liberal
King Turd of Shit Mountain ,liberal
so at this point there is zero doubt as to why comey was fired and that they scrambled to find some other reason to make it look legit and then on top of that this fucking moron actually thought firing comey would magically make the whole thing go away and told this to russians unbelievable ,liberal
Another Trump comment to add to the obstruction of justice case against him ,liberal
Dude this shit is getting ridiculous My Facebook feed is less dramatic than the Trump investigation The pure disregard for reality shows a true lack of common sense ,liberal

He was unfit for his job because his job was to get me in trouble Trump probably ,liberal
So Trump keeps talking to Russians and yet has no ties to them ,liberal
Fake news I m against Trump myself but all these completely unverifiable unnamed sources are too vague for my liking Then add to that the also unverifiable leaks coming from the intelligence agencies all seem like desperate measures As I said I m anti Trump but I cant look past the hypocrisy of the Intelligence agencies leaking information and conversations about whether you like him or not their commander and chief ,liberal

Trumpshits have turned against Elon now ,liberal
Elon musk is a self made man on a level that Trump can only dream about Tesla now has a larger market value than GM It took him barely a decade to build a company that is competing with the behemoths of the automobile industry Trump is worth way less than he says he is And the only reason he got even that far was the money he inherited and by cheating thousands of investors contractors employees ,liberal
The upside here is that the Paris agreement requires three years of participation and since the US joined it in late 2016 Dump can t initiate the leave proceedings until 2019 at which point it will take a year or longer to finalize everything It s going to be a 2020 issue Let s see if the corporate DNC fucks up again and nominates someone unelectable or if we get an actual progressive candidate this time around Like say Bernie ,liberal

Kansan here do I vote the same place I voted for Oh God oh God anyone but trump Or is this only for certain districts ,liberal
Serious question Why do Kansans seriously think particularly at this point that the GOP has their state s best interests at heart It absolutely boggles my mind please help me understand this EDIT Thanks everyone for the informative answers I was glad to receive replies from people from all sides of the political spectrum I am sad however that the general consensus seems to be that the issues that motivate Kansas GOP voters are not based in rationality social and religious issues for ex As such it becomes extraordinarily difficult to overcome the rabid commitment such voters have in supporting their party Our only hope is to vote and not nearly enough people who want progressive change have had the commitment GOP voters in Kansas have Hopefully this changes tomorrow ,liberal

Pro tip Upvoting is not real voting ,liberal
To all the negative Nancies in this thread if you keep saying LOL the Dems have no chance of winning because no one s gonna show up to vote it ll become a self fulfilling prophecy people will be demoralized thinking their candidate has no chance of winning and then not turn out to vote leading to more comments like yours which leads to lower turn out Much better instead to let people know that if they live in Barber Butler Chautauqua Comanche Cowley Edwards Elk Greenwood Harper Harvey Kingman Kiowa Pratt Sedgwick Stafford Sumner or Pawnee County KA they need to get out tomorrow and vote Yes the odds are slim but if they give up the odds will be zero And slim odds are better than none ,liberal

Yep Paul Ryan wrote it The GOP will try to pass it Trump won t even have read it Edits I don t think it ll actually pass But they have 100 of the blame if it does ,liberal
On a related note I ve been very intentionally referring to Trump as The Republican President It s more specific than other ways of avoiding saying the name of He Who Must Not Be Named like 45 or Drumpf or whatever And it can reasonably used in discussions outside liberal echo chambers Let s give full credit where it is due ,liberal
I totally agree The best way to get Republicans to distance themselves from this bill is to let them know we ll hold them accountable when it fails I d encourage everyone especially in red states to write call fax carrier pigeon their senators and let them know that this is on them and we won t forget Edit Here s a postcard I sent to Trump and my Representatives https www actiontoday org postcard Ckhak The American people won t forget which party kicked millions of of their health plans that guaranteed them coverage If you re unable to act in the interests of the millions of Americans who suffer from chronic illness then think of your own self interest in your next election cycle This is an opportunity to show us that you are one of the few Republicans left who are willing to put your constituents above your party Choose wisely We will remember what decision you make ,liberal

I like to think of it as the unaffordable health care act But Republicare is shorter and rolls off the tongue better ,liberal
If I may be so callous the reason why the term Obamacare worked so well in angering certain people is because they are able to use all their hatred for Obama and project it onto the ACA Hence calling it Trumpcare or Ryancare allows people to conjure up whatever stupidities associated with Trump and Ryan and project it onto the AHCA Calling it Republicare might be too diffuse from an attacking standpoint since it does not associate with any particular Republican and also brings to mind some of the more moderate Republicans ,liberal

Millions of people die because of Obamacare yet you probably never batted an eye cause it was just trying to fix a broken system Okay that didn t work Now what Let s move on to something else please Sticking with the shitty broken Obamacare system because of petty partisan bullshit is way worse than not even trying to fix it ,liberal
Millions of people are going to lose their healthcare and die because of this bill Millions There were only 10 4 million signed up for the program as of June of last year So you are assuming at least one fifth of those signed up have some sort of fatal disease that will kill them within the next four years ,liberal
This is some shit right here https www congress gov bill 115th congress house bill 1275 all info r 24 It s called World s Greatest Healthcare Plan of 2017 Edit I ve been told this isn t the same bill as Republicare Either way the name is ridiculous ,liberal
We need to really push this on the media and the Democrats too who keep calling it some variation of Obamacare replacement They were more than happy to be manipulated by the right into using the term Obamacare turnabout is fair play ,liberal

Yeah the republicans who disagree with the bill may be good for us because they ll probably prevent it from passing but the reason that crew disagrees is because the bill is basically too humane for their black shriveled hearts The Republican vision for America is an oligarchy It makes sense that their president is so closely aligned with Russia because their party basically wants the U S to be Russia ,liberal

I was at this jamboree The speech was fucking terrible He started and ended with the generic Boy Scouts are great they re the pillar of American democracy bullshit everyone does but the middle was all him bragging He couldn t even take half an hour to distance himself from politics to talk about the Boy Scouts achievements He couldn t talk about the 100 000 hours of community service we were doing that week He had to talk about how he won the electoral college and about his orgies and how much he gets to party He even had a dementia moment and told us we would have great sex in the future instead of success All the volunteers from the OA around me at least were disgusted by his speech And then he has the audacity to say that we loved it Fuck him ,liberal

Manafort was Trump s campaign manager for five months During those five months the Republican convention happened the one where Trump s team fought to weaken a pro Ukraine amendment to platform During those five months the DNC was hacked and Trump asked Russia to hack Hillary s emails Manafort has strenuously denied ever working for Russian interests At what point do even the most skeptical non believers start to think there might be some fire behind all of this smoke ,liberal
Honest question Is this probable cause for treason sedition or other high crime If yes why hasn t he been arrested already if no what other evidence needs to come to light ,liberal

I doubt that Manafort is an ideologue This type of guy does nothing unless for money How much was he paid by Trump or the GOP Probably nothing I don t think what he s done can be called business as usual no matter how he his lawyers twist it This man is a foreign agent the old fashioned version which means TRAITOR ,liberal

I don t get this to be honest Kneeling has been a sign of respect and humility for thousands of years People kneel before Kings and kneel to pray In my mind kneeling is a greater sign of respect than standing with head high and placing ones hand on their chest How this became a sign of protest and why people are so upset by it is beyond me ,liberal
Exactly I guess waving the flag of actual traitors who actually committed treason and actually resulted in a half a million American deaths because human beings wanted to own other human beings is AOK A few kids playing a kids game doing something he perceives as disrespectful albeit peacefully is the real problem though There is no amount of faux rage that can convince me that the President s reaction to the NFL isn t stupid And I am all for people conservagashes boycotting the NFL if they are that worried about it That is what America is about ,liberal

I cannot stand it when people use the whole disrespecting the flag and all those who died defending it excuse to trash this I served 5 years in our Navy and I didn t serve those years for a fucking flag I served them for the constitution that flag represents The same constitution that gives football players the right to kneel during the national anthem just as it gives Alt righters the right to march and wave confederate flags And I am so sick of people using mine and every other veterans service as their bat to beat on people for exercising those rights when they d probably froth at the mouth if someone suggested raising taxes to pay for increased defense spending ,liberal
Here s the deal for me as a veteran The flag is a symbol Symbols can be interpreted subjectively That s the whole point of them When I raised my right hand and swore the Oath of Enlistment in the presence of the Flag it meant something to me that I will absolutely never forget When I saw the Flag draped over my friend s coffin it meant something then too But that s MY interpretation What it might mean to others is different I acknowledge that The oath I swore was to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States and in that little piece of paper resides the 1st Amendment It s the first because it s the most important Freedom of speech and freedom of expression are paramount to the American way of life I defended that right and others have died defending it This includes my friend The Flag represents their sacrifice to those rights That s what it means to me So to not respect it by stomping on it burning it and kneeling during the National Anthem hurts me and the memories of th,liberal

Can anyone here share if they were de registered as a voter If this is true we need to make it known ,liberal
I want a better source for this Extraordinary claims require you know at least some evidence I think that voter ID laws may have swung a few states and it seems quite possible that the Russians coordinated with certain groups or individuals on the right in order to micro target certain precincts with fake news swaying voters but I don t think that the voter rolls were actually fucked with by Putin This is an extremely important thing to get right we don t want to lose ourselves to conspiracy land ,liberal
That would do it Some would be able to re register on the day and some wouldn t vote as their location would suggest but overall it would push the numbers in Trump s favor ,liberal

Didn t this happen during the NY primaries to stop people from voting for bernie ,liberal
I know I will be downvoted to hell but anyone that was paying attention during the primaries will know and remember this This was going on during the democratic primaries since many Bernie voters needed to be registered as democrats in order to vote in closed primary states When it came time to vote many of those had been unregistered or their affiliation were switched back to unaffiliated or independent and therefore had to vote on provisional ballots Yes there was voter registration manipulation but I m sorry it wasn t done by the republicans it was initiated by the democratic party and the Clinton campaign themselves in order to take Bernie out of the primaries ,liberal
Before I start keep in mind that I m not an expert and these are numbers that I in my non expert opinion believe are less terrible than they really should be and so the end result will be less lost votes than I think is likely Let s get to an EXTREMELY rough estimate of how many votes for Hillary this might have removed from the race About 50 of people eligible to vote do so that s 11m Let s say something like 60 I m expecting much higher would ve voted for Hillary That makes 6 6m Let s round that down to 6m to be EXTRA conservative in the estimate Let s say that roughly 1 6th could register on the same day as the election I expect it to be much less That makes about 5m lost votes for Hillary 5m and I ve skewed the numbers so that would be WELL BELOW what it should be Fucking hell Now I guess it depends on where the votes where but that s an election lost right there Edit According to this https ropercenter cornell edu polls us elections how groups voted groups voted 2016 website 89 of,liberal

You can t be a hypocrite if you re always lying Jerry The futility of pointing out Trump s lies and bullshit it s wearying Everyone knows he s lying even the ones who trust him totally The trick is convincing them that his lying is wrong even when they re indifferent to it That s a long term project given that politicians and journalists have been legitimizing political lies for decades ,liberal
This is the single Trump story that I thought should have disqualified him from being President in 98 of the countries eyes When you learn about how this went down and what that racist vindictive impulsive motherfucker did it should automatically keep him from being taken seriously about almost anything I thought this should have been a bigger story during the campaign But turns out most of us are too dumb too apathetic or too cruel to care about any of it ,liberal

I m trying to remember my info from an old college class as I m getting ready for my new college class But didn t Trump take out full page ads in every NYC paper calling for their execution after their arrest but before their conviction Like every week I d look it up but I m in a hurry I ll update this comment after class if someone doesn t correct me or add the correct links Edit it s 15 hours and I m finally after class Just before homework I haven t researched it completely but I have read stuff from another page He did take out four 1 page ad 2 weeks after the attack It called for bringing back the death penalty and bringing back the police He still holds them accountable to this day He has called their release and payout the biggest scam in NYC history ,liberal

Plus what facts do you need to denounce the KKK It should have been easy to say a something like we re still trying to understand all the specifics about what happened but in any situation I denounce the KKK and all it stands for ,liberal
This is exactly the commentary I was hoping would come in the wake of trump s comments ,liberal
The Armstrong report concluded that the five men whose convictions had been vacated had most likely participated in the beating and rape of the jogger and that the most likely scenario was that both the defendants and Reyes assaulted her perhaps successively 43 68 The report said Reyes had most likely either joined in the attack as it was ending or waited until the defendants had moved on to their next victims before descending upon her himself raping her and inflicting upon her the brutal injuries that almost caused her death 43 68 ,liberal
That s what really gets me about Trump He s a goddamn hypocrite a putrid sack of shit who only cares about waiting for the facts when it s the Nazis in trouble ,liberal
The worst part isn t that he jumped to conclusions but even when found innocent he still wouldn t change his position and said they should be locked up anyway ,liberal
We have had a group of racists install themseves into our white house and it is a horrific thing They had all those years seething with hate because we had a black man in The horrific is the right was so duped and fell so easily in line with the rhetoric ,liberal
Best part is of course that even after Trump got the facts even after DNA evidence cleared them of the crime Trump still wanted them put to death It goes beyond jumping to conclusions into straight up Old White Man s Undying Suspicions ,liberal
Leaving this here for anyone who wants to learn more about this case from a NY detective http www thedailybeast com the myth of the central park five ,liberal
The reason so many people still think these five men were guilty is because they probably were There 11 different women that same night in central park who claimed that there was a group of teens going around and assaulting women They claimed to the police that they did stuff to her while she was on the ground The guy who came forward while in prison and said he was the attacker that doesn t fit the description of every person who was assaulted that night by a group of teens The evidence shows that Matias Reyes committed the initial rape and the 5 boys found her some minutes later took turns raping her as well What is not in doubt with anybody is that these five boys spend the night robbing beating and sexually harassing at least 11 women that night throughout central park Was IS in doubt was whether they actually raped this woman after Reyes or just looked at her and groped her Its OK we can keep perpetuating the myth that these were a bunch of wonderful young men on their way to chur,liberal
He probably thought it takes one to know one ,liberal
Yeah he doesn t do facts unless it strokes his ego ,liberal
That s because when you re accused of sexual assault NOBODY has qualms about jumping to conclusions Once anyone hears an accusation of rape they immediately assume it s true until proven otherwise and even then they still don t fully believe it didn t happen and think you got away with it ,liberal

Jesus Christ George That was god damn brutal ,liberal
Good thing Trump has gov t provided insurance as president He ll need it after that burn ,liberal
See this is what happens when you let poor people get rich from hard work George Clooney doesn t have that cosy ignorance of always having been rich since birth therefore he s prone to use his new social standing for the betterment of others We need to keep The Arts the preserve of the rich and wealthy otherwise there s just no knowing how many of these hippies will get in the way of Our short term profit making ,liberal
Huh And here I didn t think there were any more reasons for me to love Clooney ,liberal
But here s the truth if Steve Bannon had Hollywood say Oh this is really great and a really good script and had they made his movie he d still be in Hollywood writing his fuckin movies and kissing my ass to be in one of his fuckin films That s who he is That s the reality It s almost like someone in Hollywood should ve given him a script or approved one of his scripts just to keep him out of the right wing That s an r Accidental_Hitler right there ,liberal

Does Trump actually have a gold toilet ,liberal
wasnt that like 40 years ago ,liberal
deleted ,liberal
Thatès because for trump supporters being part of the elite has nothing to do with the amount of money in your account It has to do with your ideals ,liberal
the right has assigned Trump whatever qualities they needed him to have to him The evangelicals are pretending that a man who has publicly stated he doesn t need or want God s word is somehow a man of God Delusion is a helluva thing ,liberal

The President or a ruler of ANY country should have good reasons for doing things not just to be spiteful I really don t see where the Energy Star program is hurting anything It is very helpful info ,liberal
I imagine most people buy Energy Star rated products because it saves them money each month on their energy bills not because it combats climate change ,liberal
I hate saving money with my new energy star furnace I had installed before winter I want my 300 monthly heating bill back dammit ,liberal
This is ridiculous He s like a frikkin Captain Planet villain at this point ,liberal
Energy Star is a stellar pun intended american initiative It has actually grown into an international standard Australia Canada the whole fucking European Union Japan New Zealand and Taiwan are all on board I m in Canada I ve got plenty of ES appliances and I m pretty pissed that Trump can actually torpedo this thing ,liberal
Gross incompetence This will kill thousands in an energy blackout Not to mention spiking energy costs like 100x over How do they not realize the billions we save by spending a few million on this ,liberal
I know this sounds crazy but being ambivalent to global warming is one thing but being actively opposed to anything that might curb its effects is another I have to wonder if like Russia thinks global warming would help them while destroying others and if that s part of why the Trump administration is so weirdly opposed to it ,liberal
I always wondered what that energy star logo http techsultan com wp content uploads 2013 10 energy_star_bios_boot png was about when I booted older PCs TIL it s an energy efficiency certification And Trump wants to kill it A voluntary certification This makes no sense Why does Trump hate clean air and energy efficiency so much ,liberal
The EPA claims that Energy Star has lowered consumers electricity bills by 430 billion contrast this with the annual administrative cost of the program of about 57 million This lower energy consumption has prevented 2 7 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions Holy shit that s a lot of money saved for a fraction of the cost ,liberal
I agree that this is a poor decision but I remember when NPR ran a few stories about Energy Star Ratings being pretty flawed You can read about them here Questions Linger Over Energy Star Ratings http www npr org templates story story php storyId 114051506 Some Energy Star Appliances May Not Be That Green http www npr org templates story story php storyId 125912545 This one was the most concerning for sure Does The Energy Star Label Need An Update http www npr org templates story story php storyId 129777527 EDIT I don t want to see Energy Star Certifications go away I want to see the process get fixed ,liberal
What I don t understand is even if you think climate change is fuck why wouldn t you fight for the Energy Star program just to encourage products that can do the same thing with less power draw ,liberal
This is not correct Trump wants to get rid of the Energy Star program because it restricts new construction considering energy star increases cost of equipment and labor for MEP contractors exponentially which in turn effects the economy and restricts growth ,liberal
We can only assume that it s on the list because That s journalism Why not find out the actual reason Seriously journalism is such a joke But there s an additional explanation The administration wishes to discontinue anything purporting to mitigate climate change If that s the case A statement is made as though it s true and then the following sentence says okay if that statement we made up to support our argument is true then x y z Give me a fucking break Do some fucking research you cunts and report facts Goddamn it ,liberal
Also the Trump administration hates kittens for no other reason than liberals love for them ,liberal
The numbers for those interested the cost of the Energy Star program comes to 17 3 trips to Mar A Lago a year 57 million It saves Americans 430 billion dollars in energy costs a year since 1992 Overall it saves the average American 7 544 302 for each tax dollar they pay into the program That s a fantastic return on investment EDIT thanks to u BuildingSci for the correction The numbers are still pretty fantastic though even when taking this into account ,liberal
Highly doubt the utility lobbyists would allow this to happen Even energy companies would like for you to use less energy because it saves them money on infrastructure That s why they ll sell you a thermostat that allows them to shut your A C off during peak periods ,liberal
Sam Bee had a good piece on this showing how energy star could have literally save lives during the Chicago blackout ,liberal
How much more fucking embarrassing can we get How can people be so unaware of the world around them If they re not unaware then they re actually evil yet people still let them run amuck It doesn t make any sense ,liberal
What is the point of this Even if you don t believe in climate change and you re in denial if you don t isn t saving energy still a good thing ,liberal
deleted ,liberal
Are you serious with this click bait headline The article says we can only assume it s because it combats climate change No evidence that this is the case at all Typical journalism from this rag these days ,liberal

Energy Star is the reason why my dishwasher leaves my dishes wet after it runs so I m like 100 for this ,liberal

Its not about being gross its about being counterproductive to society and civil rights ,liberal
Weaver ran against him last round and he just ignored her to make sure she got as little media presence as possible He ll do the exact same thing this round Source I m in King s district ,liberal
Let s not kid ourselves white supremacists are deeply intertwined in the history of the US It s American as apple pie or baseball which didn t integrate until nearly 90 years after the Emancipation Proclamation It s been there every step of the way and will continue to do so until we start taking an active role in eliminating it s legitimacy and acceptance ,liberal
Do you have a link to something that proves the claim you make in the first sentence of the title Because this article does not even begin to do so ,liberal
