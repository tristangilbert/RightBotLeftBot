Dear Mr Trump Thank you for running for president We know it is a major hardship for you and that you have nothing to gain and everything to lose by becoming president the exact opposite of Hillary but millions of people are thankful for your service in our hour of need Remember that we are behind you and it is your leadership which is needed so desperately as America has lost its way and purpose We are eternally grateful ,conservative

He said he is not someone who promote same sex marriage however he does believe in civil union to say that a gay person can visit his partner and that does not inhibit his core beliefs I guess those who voted and irate about change only listened to the first half of the speech and not the latter ,conservative
TRUMP They have ruled on it I wish that it was done by the state I don t like the way they ruled I disagree with the Supreme Court from the standpoint they should have given the state it should be a states rights issue And that s the way it should have been ruled on Chris not the way they did it This is a very surprising ruling And I I can see changes coming down the line frankly But I would have much preferred that they ruled at a state level and allowed the states to make those rulings themselves WALLACE But but just to button this up very quickly sir are you saying that if you become president you might try to appoint justices to overrule the decision on same sex marriage TRUMP I would strongly consider that yes http www foxnews com transcript 2016 01 31 ted cruz attacks donald trump financial record trump responds ,conservative
So first day in office the page for LGBT rights is removed from the White House s web page Seems totally supportive ,conservative
What did trump think about it 7 years ago Without knowing that this post is meaningless it just means trump is as progressive on gay marriage as Obama is right now ,conservative
He doesn t support gay marriage personally He believes that as a democracy more specifically a republic the people have a right to choose And he respects the country s decision because the court has decided ,conservative
Ok as a bisexual European I was afraid of Trump winning for American LGBT being noped out because of him Then I learned more about Hillary and saw more good things for Trump I begin to feel happy that Trump won ,conservative
Well I mean you have to consider that first and foremost Politics breeds dishonesty Not necessarily lying but hiding things Anyway I think it s good that he wants to support it However I don t understand the backlash at Obama for not being with it 100 of the time If we remember while he was running the first time it was such a hot button issue that any wrong rhetoric regarding LGBTQ community could cost an election and a lot of your following So almost no candidates back then openly were 100 for Gay rights If anything I think this signifies a great change in our country s mindset ,conservative

Is it possible that the videos were removed not beucase they were protecting anti trump people but because they see it as encouraging hate crimes against whites YouTube would take the videos down if they were a bunch of white trump supporters attacking a black Clinton supporter too ,conservative

This is horrifying The main point Donald tried to make when he accepted the Presidency was that we need to come together and unite He said it s time to come together And we see these literally staged protests which leads to a mentality like this among our citizens This is so sad to watch Every single establishment entity trying to bash on this man who just wants to make our country a better place for EVERYONE ,conservative

I guess this just exemplifies what I find disturbing about the presidency right now One of the worst cabinets of all time without an ethics review is being voted in to run our government People who voted for him probably were hoping he would do a bit better on the cabinet picks Instead of steering the party towards intellectualism and experience instead the people who voted for Trump expressing some dismay over the poor choices getting a picture on Reddit is the top priority of people who voted for him Sad ,conservative

Bottomline there s a e mail admitting of guilty of deleting classified info and cover up of scandals from Hillary to Huma why they waited this long what the actual motivation was who will ever know but this would have not been reopened this close to election unless it was absolutely criminal and we will know before election day too FBI can t allow her to walk in white house ,conservative

FBI and those in charge are hedging their bets as it becomes more and more clear that Trump will win They save face and purport to be investigating in good faith from the top Then Obozo can pardon HRC after Trump victory and before transition of the Presidency He can pardon her while the the remaining hypnotized masses are informed that it s merely a formality due to the fact that Weiner was found with some of the deleted email who knows if he really was Only thing then is BO may himself remain exposed post HRC pardon after Trump FBI DOJ is empowered Could also be of course that they are scrambling at the top now and Comey has gone rogue to mitigate his own personal exposure Interesting times Interesting times Wow just saw this link below in the comments Looks like it may be every man woman for themselves as the scrambling for reduced exposure spreads Will be very interesting to see DOJ reaction http www politicususa com 2016 10 28 doj complaint filed fbi director james comey interferi,conservative

What difference at this point does it make It is now media s job to figure out what happened and do everything they can to prevent it from ever happening again CNN and the running dogs of the popular press don t care a wit whether the American people were voting to rid themselves at long last of this crooked Clinton or if the people were voting simply for an alternative to the crushing scale of scary socialism repeatedly thrust upon US as Obama bin Biden s revenge regime pounded the pliant nation with his slippery fundamental transformation of America Either way they were as impotent as the Russians were controlling the outcome ,conservative
She lost because no amount of pandering and designer pants suits can hide her history of being a slithery corrupt politician And the way she belittled anybody that didn t blindly follow her did it for me Then the way the liberals kicked and screamed because they didn t get their way made me way more confident in the trump victory I m not a trump fan but thank God Hillary didn t win ,conservative
This is good for a laugh and all but it goes so much deeper than campaign strategy She lost because despite winning the popular vote she is someone who deserved to lose She was the wrong candidate at the wrong time who rigged her way into being the candidate within a system that is itself rigged against democracy in fear that real democracy can t be trusted However if I were to point to the core reason she lost it s because she forgot the person she once was and let the system corrupt her into thinking real change isn t possible and that what many may say is impossible is only that which we haven t achieved yet Politics is the art of making what appears to be impossible possible https youtu be 2CAUOa5m5nY She said that and it s like she forgot she ever said that or believes that person was just a stupid kid when really that person probably would have won just like Bernie probably would have won America just didn t want to be told anymore that incrementalism is all the US govt has to of,conservative
It doesn t matter who you ask the answer is almost always the same Why did Hillary Clinton lose Because I was right the whole time Observe Donald Trump I won I knew I was a winner Hillary Clinton Comey cost me the election I knew there was a vast right wing conspiracy Bernie Sanders The establishment candidate lost I knew I hated the establishment Kellyanne Conway She didn t do well enough in the mostly white Midwest I knew she was out of touch with real America Jennifer Palmieri She didn t do well enough in the mostly white Midwest I knew they were sexist Nate Silver People overestimated her chances based on an insufficient understanding of how poll trends aggregate I knew people didn t understand polling well enough ,conservative

Well it s not a great conversation for sure But I think it s to be expected when you initiate it with a comment that entertains the premise that discussing how an underlying biological function might lead people to take what they believe to be a rationally minuscule chance of an unwanted outcome pregnancy is somehow equivalent to an expression of internal external sexuality along with all of its cultural attachments One is a thing that just happens nobody asks themselves hey do I want to have my biology undermine my ability to make a critical decision with all the facts and necessary insight It just happens If they knew it was happening many would be able to control it but they don t know so they cannot which was my original point Without turning people into really weird automatons it s not feasible to nurture this behavior out of folks For evidence of this just read some of the reams of pages about the Catholic Church and sexual abuse Meanwhile gender and identity can for many be a ve,conservative

There s so much misunderstanding misrepresentation and veiled bigotry in this image post Reading so many of the comments is disheartening and shows why we re so divided as a nation So many people don t want discourse or a conversation they just want to be correct Most people in successful relationships will tell others that being correct gets you no where Try to apply that to this situation On a human level the right and left argument is really a relational problem The real issue is people think it s better to point out differences and make fun of a group for being wrong instead of trying to bridge the gap talk and then move on to solve the real problem ,conservative

a fact she is open about Her story is kind of interesting if you d read it ,conservative
First off he was NOT a homosexual lets be clear about that He picked up THREE WOMEN thinking they were prostitutes lets be honest about this story I do not condone her prior life s actions but sometimes a person has to sink to their lowest before they can rise to their highest I do not know her as a person but I know that people often through their lives do things they are not proud of We dont know her upbringing or what she experienced to cause her to become that person but she was sentenced to prison and served her time I personally wouldnt believe a word spoken by someone who told me how to be a better person if they themselves knew nothing of what they spoke She served 27 years in prison but lets not lie and say this man was gay gay men dont pick up what he believes to be 3 prostitute females So if there is THAT misinformation being spread then what else are you being fooled into believing What she did was heinous but keep in mind the victim and she knew each other prior and togeth,conservative

I ve made this point before but I ll state it again The problem with good ideas is that they almost always get hijacked by loudest minority because it s easier to digest which in turn muddies the water Take feminism I don t think any reasonable person would think that a female should get treated or paid any differently to a male for the same job That s perhaps one of the core values of 2nd and 1st wave feminism Yet the discourse is hijacked by obnoxious SJWs and we get offended by them because of how stupid they are As a result some people state that they don t like feminism Conversely there s nothing inherently racist about fixing an illegal immigrant problem it s unfair to those individuals coming in legally produces a whole heap of social problems and is hurting taxpayers However the discourse is hijacked by racist hillbillies and KKK members and we get offended by them because of how stupid they are As a result some people state they don t like immigration control The problem is is,conservative

The real question is is there anything one can do to not be racist The answer of course according to this part of the left is nothing No matter what you say or do no one can escape a label of racism What s a racist supposed to do to atone for the assumption of guilt As you might expect simply handover all political power and wealth and don t ever speak up again and you ll be marginally tolerated The only way to win is not to play Divisive fringe elements like this need to be revealed as intolerable and rejected by society ,conservative

I m not saying context isn t important but to suggest that the context of the Quran makes all of those violent passages mean something entirely different is a bit asinine There are so many verses in the Quran that explicitly call for violence and warfare against non believers and other fucked up passages about women and such Reading the whole Quran doesn t somehow make those passages disappear Like even you can t deny you are going through a shit ton of analysis semantics referring to some Muslim scholars but not others trying to choose which Muslim text carries more weight etc in order to arrive at some conclusion that says Islam is a perfect non violent religion Why is it so hard Whatever happened to just be a good fucking person You shouldn t have to make all these excuses for a religion Muslim ideology has contributed to so much suffering around the world and yet it s more important for moderate Muslims to try to find loopholes in the Quran and defend their religion than it is to c,conservative
The only way this will slow is to have strong secular leaders in the middle east but that isn t going to happen any time soon ,conservative
I like to write stupid things oh such an asshole but I am a cartoonist oh sorry my mistake you are totally okay ,conservative
Just to play devil s advocate why can t they be free to believe what they believe but not do things that are illegal Do you think anyone has the right to dictate what anyone else believes I think we both agree that there should be a system that dictates what any persons can do to any other persons but I think the argument could be made that someone s mind is their own ,conservative

Yeah unlike Muslims Christians would never preach that women should be subservient to men 1 Timothy 2 8 15 8 Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing 9 I also want the women to dress modestly with decency and propriety adorning themselves not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes 10 but with good deeds appropriate for women who profess to worship God 11 A woman should learn in quietness and full submission 12 I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man she must be quiet 13 For Adam was formed first then Eve 14 And Adam was not the one deceived it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner 15 But women will be saved through childbearing if they continue in faith love and holiness with propriety and they would never preach for the killing of gays and lesbians Leviticus 20 13 If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman both of them have done what is detestabl,conservative
I see why this is a comic because you can t find an lefty who is fine with Muslims beheading homosexuals irl only ones made of straw ,conservative
No Muslim I have ever met has ever wanted gays dead or to have women without rights I kindly encourage everyone here to go and actually meet some Muslims ,conservative
To act as if the typical liberal really thinks that is ridiculous ,conservative
Well yeah No Islam ,conservative
That is probably because Japan has not been involved in Military action in Middle Eastern countries and is a major customer of oil from the region The people funding the terrorists probably get a lot of their money from oil sales ,conservative
wewlad this place has been brigaded hard ,conservative
LOL The fucking libshit brigade really rolled this place hard Like a muslim invasion in London ,conservative
Is that a fair comparison Tokyo has never meddled in middle eastern affairs We literally waged several wars there and controlled who got in power against the will of their people Add to the fact that we literally fund saudi arabia who in turn funds wahhabism and terrorism across the world Seems like our governments are allied with the wrong people and we have it coming ,conservative
is there any _other_ kind of terrorism there ,conservative
To be fair only a few years ago a guy ran a truck into a group of people and then started attacking people with a knife in Akihabara It s not terrorism but stuff like it can happen in Japan ,conservative
Tokyo has very few mosques and is considerably larger than London I ve never heard of an incident like this happening ,conservative
Tokyo has had its fair share of terrorist attack too ,conservative
Don t be a dingus You forgot about Aum Shinrikyo https en m wikipedia org wiki Aum_Shinrikyo ,conservative
It actually was all over the news both my local here in MO and national news online ,conservative
You know if he was white we d still be hearing about the story If he used an assault rifle it s be national news This is the correct opinion ,conservative
I don t give a fuck about anyone else but me too ,conservative
But if the liberal narrative is to change and reform gun control laws because they don t work then surely this case reinforces that idea because clearly these laws didn t work even when they re strict Also maybe it s more due to media saturation of United Airlines and Sean Spicer than because it doesn t fit into some narrative Not gonna lie this argument stated off quite well and fair but just descended into bla bla bla screw liberals ,conservative
Here we go Republicans freaking out about fakr news while our glorious failure in Chief is off playing golf again after dropping a literal bomb ,conservative
To be fair it was extensively covered YOU just didn t see it If you don t see it it must not be covered at all huh It was all over Reddit all over major news channels You re pushing you re own BS narrative here ,conservative
Who isn t reporting on this ,conservative
Forgot the outspoken Christian part and the part where it was televised nationally I live in Canada and it was all over my news ,conservative
Um more like it s probably because it wasn t actually a mass murder like most school shootings The guy murdered his wife at her job he didn t go on a killing spree if they reported it every time this happened there d literally be no time for other news It s funny you re all righteous about this event like it somehow proves something but in all likelyhood you have not a single clue who 99 of the people on this list https en wikipedia org wiki List_of_rampage_killers_ Americas are ,conservative

The fact that Bernie gave Hillary a pass on the e mail bullshit at the debate tells me he isn t overly interested in winning ,conservative
Doesn t take a conservative to agree with this one Hell doesn t even take an american ,conservative
Yea Regardless of party we can all agree at least if you are a thinking person that Hillary Clinton is one of if not the most corrupt politician of our age ,conservative

I know the Koreans in LA needed more than a few rounds to defend against the mob Ferguson and Baltimore citizens would have liked that as well ,conservative
I m late to the party so this will probably just get buried but despite being a leftist I don t really feel that passionate about gun control Yeah I would support stricter gun control laws but I m sick of us losing elections because of the fear that Obama will take all of our guns away remember when that happened Also after Sandy Hook I m convinced it will never happen in this country What I really don t like about our culture of guns is what I ll call the cowboy mentality I feel like a lot of conservative men I ve known talk about gun ownership like a violent power fantasy where they titillate themselves thinking about the day they might get to kill another person in self defense or some other form of legitimized murder The meme this thread is based on is no exception ,conservative

Most liberals especially older ones ref sensible people Bill maher despises trump yet has condemned these riots as far back as Ferguson ,conservative
I want to concur with other commenters and say thanks for the civility Based on your list of what you believe in it would be my opinion that you re already more conservative for lack of a better term For the most part we believe very much the same If I read between the lines it sounds like you might have been turned off by the religious components of the conservative movement of the past but I think we re in a time of much more forgiving Christians who simply want equal access to their beliefs The good news is what you propose is a good starting point to work from in commonality and work out differences of opinion from there ,conservative

I disagree with the notion that conservatives other ideologies don t read listen to liberal news sources Its impossible not to because the vast majority of news is blatantly liberal leaning That s why they got it so wrong Polls were completely wrong Pundits were completely wrong Because conservatives backlashed ,conservative
Apology not accepted FIX YOUR SIDE However I am glad that you see the problems that are evident with your fellow liberals But we re tired of having to fix your problems for you thus my rationale for the lack of acceptance of your apology Regardless welcome And maybe listen to the other people here my advice to you would be to listen to the people commenting on here ,conservative
I want to apologize to Although I am not 100 democrat I am one of the most liberal people I know I don t believe we can stop Trump from inaugurating but I do believe the country made a mistake and will do what I can to stop him and rally my side to obstruct him if he tries to enact any of the real extreme positions he mentioned on the campaign trail I have been attacking Trump furiously for months now really and am only getting louder But I have no qualms with his whole group of supporters or voters A lot of people have been attacking you guys personally A lot of people have bern attacking republicans in general That s not right that s not democratic it s not American I am sorry this is happening to you and please remember as much as notalltrumpsupporters is true so is notalltrumpprotesters This crazy ride isn t over yet Stay strong stay safe ,conservative
