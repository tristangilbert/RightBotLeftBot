America has a proud tradition of stealing the most brilliant and talented people from countries around the world for ourselves Albert Einstein Wernher von Braun Arnold Schwarzenegger Melania Trump the list goes on and on In recent years however H 1B visa abuse has become rampant A program meant bring truly exceptional talent to America has been twisted by globalist politicians and corporations allowing low cost short term labor to steal jobs from everyday Americans and take everything they learn back to their home countries Will you curb H 1B abuse and make sure visas are going to people who want to become American stay American and make America great ,conservative
Mr Trump on behalf of r asktrumpsupporters we would like to ask you the following questions Question 1 We firmly believe Hillary will try and steal this election through vote fraud especially given recent events What is your campaign doing to ensure that we have a fair election Question 2 What role should NASA play in helping to Make America Great Again Question 3 How do you feel about WikiLeaks Does it change your opinion on Snowden Question 4 What is your opinion on Net Neutrality Question 5 Has your campaign ever gotten any ideas from the_donald Thank you for taking the time to join us today and we look forward to continuing to Make America Great Again with you Sincerely r asktrumpsupporters A subreddit dedicated to explaining to non supporters why we are Trump supporters and why they should be too ,conservative

Mr Trump Reports estimate that 90 of US media is owned by 6 companies The US mass media has fused into a gross alliance with big business and big government as this election has shown more than any other The dishonest media is rigging our democracy with a radical agenda that divides Americans and causes nothing but sensationalism and hatred at the expense of the USA They are killing our country for ratings and profit with impunity How will you as president tackle this protected class of media elites without stepping on the first amendment rights of average Americans ,conservative
Mr Trump you ve been on record saying the war on drugs has failed The war on drugs has cost the US hundreds of billons of dollars over decades Building the wall is one way to stop the crossing of hard drugs into our country but as some states have shown legalizing marijuana or medical marijuana has lead to tax and tourism revenue Under a Trump administration what will the federal stance be on recreational marijuana medical marijuana and is there any possibility of legalization for much needed revenue ,conservative

Mr Trump Everyday when I leave my Manhattan office I stop to have a friendly talk with our front desk security manager Larry Larry is an African American man in his early 50 s a lifelong democrat and of the true salt of the earth character that makes this city and indeed this country great For the past few months Larry has talked almost exclusively about the election and routinely expressed fear and doubt about you as a candidate Today however for the first time Larry said that he liked how Trump sounded today and now thinks this guy could win Mr Trump if you were to speak to Larry a working class African American man in his 50 s what would you tell him as to why he should vote for you I promise I ll pass it along to him tomorrow Also are we having the victory party in front of Trump Tower in November Thanks and MAGA ,conservative
Hello Mr Trump I m 29 years old registered Libertarian and have voted that way my entire life I feel closely aligned with what the party stands for and am passionate about it However this election I am starting to think that while I think a Libertarian candidate is what s best for America long term that you may be what America needs right now I also feel like you care about this country so so much and you want what s best for it This is a difficult decision for me because on the issues I seem to either firmly believe or strongly disagree with what you have to say I think you may be the best possible candidate for our economy but I do fear some of your international policies I know that I am not the only 3rd party voter that feels this way So my question to you is what do you say to people like me who are on the fence about voting 3rd party Johnson Stein or for you Thank you very much for doing this AMA ,conservative

Dear Mr Trump My name is William and I am a Nuclear Engineering student at North Carolina State University The Democrats have treated nuclear power horribly Nuclear power struggles to compete in the market because of unfair subsidies placed on solar and wind energy by the Democrats Many of our plants have been shut down and many more are expected to close in the next 20 years The Democrats have opposed the construction of new plants which would create many high paying jobs in construction and engineering because they believe nuclear power is not safe even though there have been no deaths from over 60 years of nuclear power in the United States I want to be a part of America s nuclear future but I am worried about finding a stable job with all these obstacles Do you support American nuclear power What are your thoughts ,conservative
Mr Trump As a Police Officer and Iraq War Vet I want to personally thank you for showing so much incredible support towards law enforcement officers and military personnel It means a lot My question If when you re elected to be the POTUS what will you do about the Fraud Waste and Abuse in the military As a 10 year veteran of the armed forces I can assure you that BILLIONS of tax payer dollars are wasted due to the unnecessary red tape and hoops the military must jump through to accomplish their mission s I d rather see those billions be invested into our nation s infrastructure What will you do to ensure this happens Bonus Question I ve emailed your campaign and my states Republic party representatives to figure out how to get involved in your campaign to turn my blue state red and I ve received no response Is there someone I can reach out to I want to do everything I can to support you to ensure we can MAGA Bonus Statement Your children are very articulate and impressive speakers I ho,conservative

Thank you for reminding why I need to block this sub ,conservative
In case you didn t get an answer The Donald had a post that was on front page of r all and we watched the mods take it to 0 so it would go away Reddit mods and admins have been censoring the group for a while now and this is in retaliation ,conservative
I cant speak for a lot of people but I can talk for myself My parents are both white legal immigrants and I was born in the lower middle class They both worked hard to try and provide for me and now I work hard to try and help provide for them I ve never seen white privilege I ve seen the opposite if anything I got bullied during most of my school for being the white kid Now I get yelled at by these people born to money and never knowing what being hungry feels like that I M privileged That I have a easy life and that I am oppressing minorities when in the area I live in im the minority Then this guy runs for president and the same people say the same things about him and the people voting for him so I read into it He starts to see like a better and better idea Now I m shit posting memes on a reddit page while I watch the media have a temper tantrum about the people voting in someone they believe in ,conservative

People don t give Trump credit for appreciating the checks and balances within gov t Everything he proposes he says how he ll accomplish it without overstepping the constitution ,conservative
I saw a post on r lgbt claiming that we re trying to gaslight people by saying trump has always supported same sex marriage Anyone who s paid attention knows that he personally is against it but believes the decision is done He accepts that TL DR trump doesn t want to get gay married Obama meanwhile there s some gaslighting for you ,conservative

I ve been a homophobe all my life but I ve come to love my homosexual brothers and sisters There was such unjustified fear and hate inside of me which I ve regretted thoroughly all these years and if I could go back to 16 year old me I would kick the shit out of him for being a deluded asshat Perhaps its the cheap brandy but I feel this is a time to apologise for whatever transgressions I d committed against other human beings I ve realised that whether you like dicks or pussy has absolutely no bearing on your value as a person And on topic I wish these rabid liberals would accept some of their own faults and possibly change for the greater good ,conservative

It s funny how the folks that are classically anti establishment are Anti Trump Perhaps if they abstained from their daily dose of progressive liberal propaganda then they will see Trump for who he is He is disruptive of the status quo He is the anti bullshit call it as it as is leader of the free world He wasn t called a racist until he ran against a democrat He loves our country more than he loves his lifestyle So fuck all of you that need to manufacturer a bad guy to hate while wearing the latest hipster glasses and wool cap He is going to fight for every American whether that fits your progressive bullshit narrative or not ,conservative
You know what I like most about this he didn t even let his personal opinion get involved That s his fucking job the courts decided so it s over with in his mind Even if he doesn t agree with it the courts and the people have spoken That s some shit a president ought to say ,conservative
He doesn t support same sex marriage He simply isn t in opposition of it ,conservative
Anyone protesting while waiving the LGBT flag right now is a disgrace I really hope they are just misinformed You are protesting a guy that was more open to gay marriage than Obama ,conservative
Now hopefully he can get his VP and the rest of his party to agree ,conservative
He is also likely to have the first openly gay person on his staff with Peter Thiel ,conservative
I voted for Gore Kerry and Obama 1 0 Donated to Kerry and Obama I proudly supported Trump and donated as much as I legally could I pissed off a few neighbors with my political signs too I was lucky enough to see him in person When he says he will make America great again he believe it to his core without a doubt He was ridiculed for 18 months and has been call every name in the book He never wavered and didn t even flinch The man just keeps winning He wins because that is all he knows how to do He believes in the Constitution and believes that all of our rights need to be protected from enemies foreign and domestic The folks and MSMs that are out scaring people for will have their day of reckoning It s just a matter of time ,conservative
Well what he said was that what he believes is irrelevant as he court has already decided It s a bit different but I m not one to argue over phrasing MAGA ,conservative

GAME ON ,conservative
Let s settle this once and for all Until January 20th the greatest President without question nor rival is Theodore Roosevelt Both as a President and as a man he was exemplary When Trump is inaugurated he has the chance to tie or even beat Teddy but he will have to make good on a lot of his promises to get there For those of you unfamiliar with Teddy Roosevelt allow me to give you some highlights Prior to being President he was known for commanding the Rough Riders in the war with Spain Famously he led the charge up San Juan Hill He charged up a hill into gunfire leading men to fight and die for Freedom He initially became a Vice President to McKinley before he died in office He served from 1901 to 1909 and later ran again in 1912 but more on that later As President he was a champion of the national park system establishing five new parks and many wildlife reserves The other big cause he was known for was Trust Busting Back then the wealthy elites ruled with mighty business monopolies ,conservative

Barry was the best because he s black and democrat thats all that matters to them ,conservative
I don t think anybody honestly believes Obama is even a great president For liberals he failed to deliver on an astonishing amount of campaign promises and he didn t bring the racial healing they thought he would he made it worse not better For conservatives he was condescending and authoritarian pushing the legal limits of the president s power to issue executive orders His main legacy is a failed healthcare policy and failed foreign policy Only completely ignorant shills and racists would put Obama in the same group as Lincoln Washington and other presidents that were actually respectable people ,conservative
The problem wasn t the drones as a technology They are now a permanent part of modern warfare The problem is the way in which targets were acquired and vetted under the Obama administration In fact drones had a better civilian safety record than manned airstrikes but the media demonized drones because they were new and scary ,conservative

To liberals from r all who came to the comments can you even recognize fellow liberals anymore Curtailing of free speech met with thunderous applause The internet is a collection of private entities exempt from first amendment protections It is the single largest and most used forum for expression and discussion yet you do not have the right to free speech anywhere on it So far most sites have decided it in their best interest not to curtail free speech even though they can And now here we are facebook twitter and reddit are now censoring speech and because it s currently comprised of opinions we do not agree with we are ok with this These are not the liberal principles I stand for What about you ,conservative
I think you guys shit up the frontpage and i hate your all caps meme spouting I don t think Trump is suited to be the president of the USA and I think his attitude towards climate change is disastrous That being said fuck Spez fuck his pathetic apology and fuck his hypocritical attitude towards this subreddit in particular I d rather endure a million shitposts on r all than have the entire site turn into one big fucking echochamber ,conservative

If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come to believe it The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political economic and or military consequences of the lie It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie and thus by extension the truth is the greatest enemy of the State Paul Joseph Goebbels https en wikipedia org wiki Joseph_Goebbels German politician and Reich Minister of Propaganda of Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945 ,conservative

We have explicit rules in our sidebar We are a 24 7 Trump party Same as r S4P and r KillaryKlinton Rules They do exist However when main default subs censor anything that goes against their narrative it will create an echo chamber that is not intended to be so We are an echo chamber here and we do not hide it We also do one hell of a job policing out the race baiting trolls and 4chan kids looking to cause trouble We do not pretend to be something we are not The verdict was made before we presented a case Some users lashed out and some just deleted their accounts Most of us have kept on the path of shitposts articles highlighting the executive transition and reminding Sanders supporters there are no refunds Each time we venture and attempt to engage in civil debate we are shadowbanned downvoted to oblivion or outright banned It is easy to claim victory in a debate when not letting the other side participate ,conservative

The Liberals at r REDACTED are even speaking out AGAINST Czar Bernschwitz on this They are so brainwashed they think TPP is a good trade deal and are denying their God to do so What world do they live in ,conservative
The way I see it with Mr Sanders he was threatened during the campaign with something so grave that he decided dying mysteriously was not worth it That s why he was quick to endorse Clinton and now it seems he is still toeing the party line But part of him wants to support the new president despite his party s fierce opposition to him So he will offer his real opinions from time to time and then keep his party handlers happy most of the time ,conservative

The real question is How can Bernie still win this ,conservative
Bernie cuck here and occasional visitor to this sub I don t agree with many of Trump s policy s but if he follows through and destroy the peer reviewed buzzword free trade once and for all and show people that free trade in that sense only exists to let corporations use what s basically slave labour to drive their growth on the expense of working families in the consuming part of the world I will give him the credit he deserves for that Let s unite where we can Our goal is the same it s just the road we chose to get there that differs ,conservative

Yep That s what I m doing now too Hopefully there are as many of us as I think there are and we can counteract this BS and hit r all even harder than before But the cynic in me has doubts Looking at r all right now you have to go down pretty far to see ANY posts from here So I have a feeling that they ve just dialed up the algorithm and used the sticky thing as a cover for it Now people will say wow they must really abuse that sticky thing I don t even need to block them anymore When in reality I never saw more than one or two posts that had been stickied at the top of r all and those were usually big posts in their own right getting 7k points despite a 50 downvoted level Also they need to do something about the brigades if they are going to keep this up If a user does nothing here but downvote then Reddit should run a simple script to block this subreddit for that user I mean there s no reason for people to do that anymore right And surely that s not what the downvote button was meant,conservative

When posts from r the_donald approach anywhere near the front page of r all they are downvoted heavily Typically they end up being somewhere around 56 upvoted For one of our posts to break a score of 216 145 we would actually need over 2 million upvotes nbsp And that assumes that the admins actually weight our upvotes equally which is unlikely EDIT u andrewism pointed out a miscalculation I made in the above scenario and it would only require a little over 1 million upvotes at 56 upvoted However if we went with the 52 upvoted that this thread has now achieved on the front page of r all it would require over 2 8 million upvotes now to reach a score of 216 145 ,conservative

Someone told me Trump admitted to sexual assault I asked when he did that and he said Are you kidding me Check the Access Hollywood tapes with Billy Bush So I looked at the transcript and Trump said When you re a star they let you do it Let that sink in They let you do it That phrase literally implies consent That is not sexual assault I can grab my girlfriend by the p ssy and if she lets me do it then it is not sexual assault The media twisted it ,conservative

I am a registered democrat I was a Bernie supporter And I don t comment often However I just want to say that the Dems rallying cries and complete lack of self awareness about Clinton and the quickness to deflect the wikiileaks revelations of collusion and corruption with the media and DNC that subverted and undermined both the primaries and general election coupled with their Hillary is our only hope attitude have left me disenfranchised from the Democratic Party It is unbelievable and inexcusable This period now could be used toward rebuilding the DNC and acknowledging that a horrible candidate was pushed against the will of the people as evidenced by WIKILEAKS to get to the point where we are today Instead they attack and refuse to accept all of what happened by pushing this clear bullshit of a Russian hack which has still to be publicly substantiated with evidence when Wikileaks which has a 100 track record of honest revelations has already stated the source was not Russia I could ,conservative

Two things can be true at once We can dislike the fact that the Russians hacked an American political party s emails and we can also recognize that the Democrats defeat likely had very little to do with that hack The Democrats were asking for trouble in the setup of their servers and their two faced approach to politics It confirmed that the Democrats were everything that we knew them to be but we shouldn t be fooled into aligning ourselves with a horrible person like Putin The fact is that Putin is a bad guy he isn t our friend He in no way represents conservative values or has any love for the US He has taken advantage of the last two presidents desire to have a cordial relationship We re mistaken if we think that just because he didn t like Hillary that he will work with President Trump If Trump really means America first then let s have an investigation Let s find out what the Russians did to an American institution However we can also say that the Democrats lost not because of the,conservative

Dude I m an independent and can t stand either candidate but the shit Trump has said over the course of this election I m not justifying anyone talking shit to his supporters but it s pretty easy to think that somebody who supports him must be cool with that stuff Even if they aren t racist sexist xenophobic they re ok with the fact that he is Just like someone who supports Hillary must be cool with corruption Edit I ve been tagged a bigot for this post A bigot is a person who is intolerant towards those holding different opinions than their own The mod who tagged me unfortunately may not have a full grasp on the concept of irony ,conservative
I appreciate this I try not to be an asshole where possible But survey data of Trump supporters have definitely seen large numbers of racism among the conservative party We Democrats have some soul searching to do as a party right now but I still believe that we aren t alone in that Frankly racism regardless of political affiliation is deplorable and should be spoken out against but the term can t be liberally applied to mean anyone who voted against my candidate I m sorry if that s happened to you unfairly This was a divisive election Let s be honest we Democrats overlooked an enormous amount of scandals from Hillary Clinton because we were so terrified of a Trump election Exit polling shows that Conservatives did the same thing in reverse Whatever happened this election can t happen again We can t have candidates that are so deeply divisive that the other party fears for the future of their country I don t believe all Trump supporters are racist I don t believe that most of them are ,conservative

While I agree with everything in this post I think you guys are happily glossing over the fact that the Trump movement absolutely included a minority voice of some scary scary shit Now that the election is over he has a duty to unify The only way to do that is to be honest about our faults While the left needs to reevaluate our demeaning attitude toward conservatives and how they ve abandoned the white middle class and how we let pure corruption run the DNC I think conservatives absolutely need to evaluate what about their party attracts endorsements from David Duke Don t just walk away from this and ignore the unpalatable aspects of the party Minority demographics are growing in this country and it will hurt the GOP down the road if that isn t addressed The election is over we can stop throwing mud at each other should ve never started Liberals were wrong on so many levels but I would hate for this moment of gloating to miss some of the important concerns within the Republican party o,conservative

Slavery still exists in Africa Caste system in india still a thing Inequality still exists around the planet and you don t need european colonialism to find it Happy 4th of July In fact there s a website called the global slavery index which basically acts like a racist scoreboard so you can keep track of which countries have the most slaves reported The US is either winning at not having slaves or losing because we re way behind china and india depending on whether or not you re a racist https www globalslaveryindex org findings Jokes aside Slavery is still an important issue and browbeating white dudes is not really an effective solution Instead I think the best possible solution would be for countries to modernize to the point that they no longer consider slavery viable Not giving funding to countries like Qatar when they build sports stadiums with slave labor would probably help too We should be drawing attention to nasty issues like child marriage and slavery because it proves hum,conservative

You can legally have sex under the age of 18 You can legally buy video games under the age of 17 You can legally have a job under the age of 16 While I think any sex change surgery should have to wait until 18 the final point is undermined by the preceding points being false ,conservative
removed ,conservative
I m sure I ll probably get downvoted for this but I think this honestly overlooks a lot of the complexity of being trans and I m also pretty damn sure this is outright inaccurate though things vary a lot from state to state The effectiveness of transitioning as treatment diminishes with time which is why people usually want to do it earlier transitioning starts with HRT for most people not surgery in the US except under special circumstances doctors won t start HRT until you re 16 in pretty much any state and even then it s up to parents because you re a minor and you generally also have to start with blockers before you can go to estrogen and while I d want to do more research before saying for sure I m pretty sure you can t under go sex reassignment surgery before 18 even if you could I m skeptical that any doctor would and it would absolutely require parental consent In the state where I live I needed mental health professional s approval a willing doctor being 16 or older and also ,conservative
Gender reassignment surgery is actually pretty much impossible to get until you turn 18 it s hormone therapy that you can get once you turn 13 This is just my opinion but I think hormone therapy for 13 year olds is fine provided that it s safely reversible in case the kid changes their mind as they get older ,conservative
It s like you have to have a mental illness in order to think people with mental illness should be able to mutilate their body at a young age ,conservative
I thought you had to be 18 to actually get the surgery I know you can start hormones earlier than that which I don t agree with but I was pretty sure 18 for surgery Is it dependent on state edit you can take hormone blockers earlier than 18 but I ve been told the effects are not permanent Less bad Look I have my feelings on letting kids start on these huge steps to alter their lives but they re pretty moderate and would just bore everyone here ,conservative

This is what happens when you generalize millions of people using 1 simplified term and then compare individuals in that group to other individuals You can t assume every person who identifies as left is a representative of the group For example the right says that they are for smaller government and less government intervention so that individual freedom can be maximized Yet they support the patriot act mass government surveillance and the war on drugs and don t want people to have the freedom to marry who they want See All this is is a rhetorical trick to take advantage of peoples desire to view those who disagree as stupid and inherently hypocrytical It is much harder to accept that the left and the right are wildly heterogeneous because then you can t generalize and create simplified ideologies to support the view you already hold ,conservative

The mikeroweWORKS Foundation is a 501 c 3 public charity that rewards people with a passion to get trained for skilled jobs that actually exist As CEO of the Foundation Mike Rowe spends a significant amount of time speaking about the country s dysfunctional relationship with work highlighting the widening skills gap and challenging the persistent belief that a four year degree is automatically the best path for the most people Through its scholarship programs including the Work Ethic Scholarship Program the Foundation provides financial assistance to qualified individuals with a desire to learn a skill that is in demand The Foundation has been instrumental in granting more than 3 million in education for trade schools across the country http profoundlydisconnected com ,conservative
I like Mike Rowe But this quote is absurd and hypocritical of him if it s true He s the biggest supporter of trade tech jobs many of which require years of training at no tiny expense An electrician for example is at least 2 years of schooling and another 2 3 apprenticing And the two years cost around 30 40K where I live Sure it s a bit cheaper than a university degree but the earning potential of the degree is 10x that of the trade tech certificate Yes we should encourage kids to do dirty jobs and we should pay better for the ones that can t be automated yet But we also need to consider that progress as a species means finding more efficient ways to do work which produces more complex problems that need creative human work to solve Not doing this is to artificially keep ourselves stuck in the good ol days and prevents our civilization from improving itself ,conservative
I have two cousins who skipped college and went to vocational schools instead One is an electrician and the other is a plumber They both make great money and are doing rewarding high scale projects for their companies I wish the US would promote more vocational schools instead of super expensive universities Hands on jobs are just as important for building up the country as any other degree I hope that more teachers encourage their students to consider alternate careers over the failsafe of a business major PS if you re a business major I recognize you as important it s just not the only career path out there ,conservative
What jobs no longer exist And what of the reverse like manufacturing jobs ,conservative
Honestly there needs to be a push for more vocational training in middle and high school In my HS I don t think I heard anything about vocational school If schools are measured on how many go to college and not just graduation rates not sure if this is the case they shouldn t get dinged if people go to vocational school instead ,conservative
I love this man so much ,conservative
What do you guys make of the promises Trump made to bring back coal mining and manufacturing jobs to this country Aren t those jobs either 1 obsolete or 2 low paying unskilled labor I wish conservatives actually held these same standards universally but when it comes to appeasing out of work blue collar workers there s no such tough love ,conservative

I watch This Old House and they had a short segment on how they are going to make an effort to educate teens and young adults about skilled tradespeople and how such jobs can be extremely rewarding and pay as well if not better than jobs many of these college kids spend many 1000s and 4 years to get assuming they get a job at all They are actually teaming up with mikeroweWORKS so that s really cool Here is the PR about it https www thisoldhouse com press room news old house ventures llc launches philanthropic initiative to empower and educate next I d be as proud of my son if he chose to become a plumber electrician or welder as if he chose to become an engineer or a doctor We have to remove the stigma that having a skilled job like I mention above is somehow a bad thing ,conservative
what jobs are we training kids for that no longer exist ,conservative
I m not sure if that quote is only a conservative view The Dem party was talking about increasing the amount of trade schools for renewable energy jobs while the Reps were talking about bringing back coal jobs I don t think the parties necessarily represent what they used to On another note Mike Rowe is awesome and I got so much respect for that guy ,conservative

Money is magic d up from nothing when students take out a loan so it s technically incorrect to say we don t have it We made it so we have it I agree that the whole higher education system in the US is outdated though I know a lot of people that are struggling through an AS degree but I don t know of a single industry where an AS degree is valued Even BS and BA degrees are only valuable in a handful of industries As jobs become more and more specialized years of generalized higher education becomes less and less relevant I would like to see more focus on vocational and certification programs Six months of technical training is enough to get your foot in the door to many career paths The higher education industry is entirely to blame for the devaluing of formal degrees in the United States They have stubbornly refused to adapt to modern times instead relying on the Middle Class compulsion to send your kids to college Colleges and universities have structured their curriculum around lowe,conservative

The BBC are at it too Claim Donald Trump claims Hillary Clinton acid washed 33 000 personal emails to delete them something he said was an expensive process Reality Check verdict A claim that has been debunked before The FBI said Clinton s team used a free software programme called BleachBit No chemicals were used When he first made this claim Trump s campaign said that he did not literally mean acid washed adding that it was a play on words and reference to a joke made by Clinton about wiping her email server with a cloth BleachBit debunked Trump s claim on its website saying the software is not very expensive adding that it is completely free of charge http www bbc co uk news election us 2016 37603685 ,conservative

As someone who has family in coal mining areas and lived as coal minera we need to get over coal fast I agree she said it wrong but I completely agree with a plan for phasing out coal energy and replacing those job with new energy jobs Coal is not the future and there is a reason why over the past two decades there has been a flight away from these areas Again coming at this purely from a business pov The coal industry like many before it is becoming g fully marginalized and if we want to create jobs in America especially areas where people are hurting the most we need to invest in jobs that will be competing over the next 50 years not delaying the inevitable by 10 years edit Im tired of meeting conservatives who can speak to a working blue collard life but have no calluses on their hands Not saying this is you but the mindset you speak from is ,conservative
There s also so much more you can add to that Told the country she was dead broke leaving the white house Acted entitled to the presidency Ran on Obamacare as a plus instead of a negative The video of her collapsing at a memorial Her laugh The fact that she s held a bunch of positions but done very little with them Was seen as a Washington insider when it was an outsider election Took money from all types of foreign governments Is quoted as saying women are the real victims of war because the men in their lives die And the list goes on and on This is just off the top of my head but you can add a lot more to the list ,conservative

Just a thought experiment here if you were to run the US election again right now one week after the first would the results be the same If the country had an option for a re do would more people turn out to defeat Trump or would they go back to Trump The left of course believes that the country has made a huge mistake and that everybody should just come to their senses and pick the heir apparent They believe the same about Brexit I m not so sure The self indulgent cry ins the safe spaces the rioting and the belittling of opponents seems to confirm everything that your typical Trump supporter loathes about the world they ve created nothing gets produced because all the youth are too busy being whiny cry bullies on do nothing campuses and the radical left not the right are the dangerous faction that can t accept defeat ,conservative
it wasn t so much the fact that she lost the presidency but that her followers lost it for her so many spastics vomiting their rhetoric over facebook and twitter eventually made it so that even people within the democrat party were jumping ship to avoid being associated with the brand best part either by my explanation or OP s liberals are not learning from their mistakes at all trump will get re elected in 2020 when they try to do the wrong thing once again hoping it will turn out right this time I guarantee it ,conservative

The calling half of the country deplorable claim pisses me off She called half of trump s supporters voters deplorable And it s fairly well known that only about 50 of eligible voters actually vote in the United States about half of which were pro Trump 25 of the eligible voting population Which means that at worst she called 12 of of the country deplorable not the over inflated 50 ,conservative
Why did the Libs pick this Monster to be their martyr ,conservative

I can confidently say after reading this thread that no conservative actually understand why Trump won It wasn t Hillary s alleged corruption it wasn t that people were tired of being called racists it wasn t because people agreed with Trumps ultra hardline stance on immigration Trump won because Trump was change Change is what the American people have wanted most since Bush left office and Trump is definitely change ,conservative

Argumentum Ad Populum Questionable one at that Most countries that have had to endure under communist torment aren t particularly fond of it For example Eastern Europe for the most part holds Nazism and Communism as comparable evils Beyond that why might people support Communism I think it boils down to naivety entitlement They see in Bernie s vernacular the top 1 holding owning inordinate sums of wealth They believe they are entitled to a piece of that pie What better way than to weaponize the state and establish collective ownership However bureaucracies are much more susceptible to squandering embezzling and mismanagement of that very wealth Communism also isn t particularly well suited for incentivizing innovation So you often end up with economic deterioration and crises of shortage The end result is not lifting the poor into the middle class but dragging the middle class into poverty ,conservative

For anyone who thinks that there isn t a liberal agenda in higher education I offer the following a student s race can be used as a tie breaker during admissions processes All admissions offices have a points system used to determine who enters and who doesn t So let s say we have a white student and a black student and each have identical records same GPA same SAT score same extra curriculars etc These stats amount to both students having an admissions score of 10 There is one seat to fill The admissions office can issue an extra point to the black student because his race adds diversity to the campus which is beneficial to the student body Wrap your head around that he isn t the better student but his race makes the school more diverse So the black student needs to be admitted while the white student is punished because of a factor neither can control or take credit for That is absolute nonsense ,conservative

No reason to be alarmed ,conservative
The big reason I think it wasn t as reported is because it was a domestic dispute on school grounds that resulted in a child death That s just a different type of scenario than when people go in to shoot up a place The intention to kill one vs many It happened a few years ago at the University of South Carolina http www thestate com news local crime article13947398 html and received very little media attention as well ,conservative
Christ I wasn t even aware there WAS a school shooting in San Bernandino I guess the media was too busy making fun of Sean Spicer for his Hitler comments to really pay any attention to a kid getting killed ,conservative
Calling it a School Shooting is misleading It was a murder suicide with unlucky bystanders ,conservative
Saw it covered on CNN when it happened I do online schooling at home nothing on MSNBC nor FOX NEWS I feel like it WAS covered well enough How did it happen Poor school security Why did it happen Clearly a dispute between a teacher and spouse spouse overreacted and killed her then himself If the news programs on TV covered every single shooting then that d be all we hear Only the big enough to be mentioned ones scroll past on the bottom of the screen just like every bombing by a terror organization that s NOT ISIS or Al Qaeda ,conservative
It was a murder suicide where a single teacher was shot by her husband Two children were caught in his fire because of their proximity to her Less of a school shooting more of a shooting that occurred in a school The guy found his wife killed her then killed himself As to why it s not being talked about HAVE YOU SEEN THE NEWS THIS PAST WEEK This was pretty cut and dry from the beginning but you have the calamity that was the Pepsi ad then you ve got the United debacle to push that under the rug then you ve got Holocaust Centers and now we ve got the first combat use of the largest non nuclear bomb in our arsenal The news cycle doesn t focus on what s important they focus on what s going to get views and ratings and this week has been a scandal shitstorm They can t keep up and something like this that s boring just gets swept under the rug ,conservative

So I hate to do this but I m going to look at the positive of the gun laws Low capacity revolver vs high capacity rifle Could have been worse Also this was on the news It was quickly pushed away by other news items but with a 24 hour news cycle that s not too surprising But it was on both national and local news not near CA The rest is completely accurate If it had been a muslim it would have been in the news for days ,conservative
The shooter was also an outspoken Christian ,conservative

Unusual to see this kind of awareness of guns in the United States from a Tumblr user ,conservative
Um more like it s probably because it wasn t actually a mass murder like most school shootings The guy murdered his wife at her job he didn t go on a killing spree if they reported it every time this happened there d literally be no time for other news It s funny you re all righteous about this event like it somehow proves something but in all likelyhood you have not a single clue who 99 of the people on this list https en wikipedia org wiki List_of_rampage_killers_ Americas are ,conservative

It is actually amazing how many people don t understand that the second amendment has nothing to do with hunting ,conservative
Honest question something both liberals and conservative may agree on if the 2nd amendment is to help prevent tyranny by offering a way for the citizens a last ditch effort to violently revolt if their non violent venues are taken away I e freedom to vote and freedoms of speech etc then why is it a typically conservative stance to also make sure the police and armed forces are armed to the teeth Would those people be the ones who would put down any type of armed rebellion It seems a conservative stance should be to have police and military armed only lightly ,conservative

I m what most of the people here would probably call pretty liberal or maybe wildly depending but I think it s disingenuous to pretend like we don t know what the founders intended when discussing the second amendment We do know because they went to great effort to spell it out in the federalist papers and similar supporting documents federalist 46 comes to mind immediately the second amendment was explicitly designed as a check against government tyranny I also hear the argument about not being able to resist tyranny with a single gun vs tanks drones etc and while there s some validity there it s less than people might think Just look at Vietnam or for that matter the modern Islamist movements a large number of people armed with fairly simple weapons can wreak havok even on our modern forces if given the opportunity and that at very least gives them a chance to resist and some hope of victory over the long haul I guess what I m saying is it should not be a partisan issue at all either,conservative

The point of the 30 round vs 10 round argument isn t about taking on an army The point is that the only fucking difference between the two is that the 30 round is more convenient for the typical recreational shooter You can put down the same amount of lead in the same amount of time with both of them So banning 30 round magazines does fuck all to prevent shootings or limit casualties What the fuck is the point to banning something if the ban doesn t do anything but cause an inconvenience of taking extra time to reload at a range And that doesn t mean it takes extra time for a mass shooter Because a shooter DOESN T RELOAD 10 OR 30 ROUNDS ONE BY FUCKING ONE INTO A MAGAZINE WHEN HE COMMITS A MASS SHOOTING ,conservative

I m in the same boat as OP I consider myself a moderate liberal and share many of the same values I don t have a problem with conservatives generally and have found that there s a lot of common ground between myself and moderate conservatives The issues that I have are generally with religiously motivated conservatives that attempt to enforce their own religious ideologies onto the people through governance and legislation The Bible and other religious texts should have no place in our government and no impact on our laws only the Constitution I think freedom of religion goes far beyond having the right for a citizen to practice a religion as they see fit I believe it also implies that governance and the law should be free of religion and religious motivations and that church and state should never be intertwined With all that being said while I m disappointed in the result of the election I accept Donald Trump as my president elect and am hopeful that we as a people can come together ,conservative
The issue has never been whether or not we could get along with radical leftists the problem continuously remains that they have an inability to reconcile their differences with anybody especially people who more or less share our viewpoints But you suffer from something that I see many self proclaimed liberals suffering from these days misidentification Everything you just listed and explained is barely an accepted value of self proclaimed liberals nowadays Let s face it the vocal minority of the left has made it loud and clear that they have no intent to cooperate and that they re committed to disruptive violent and aggressive revolution until they get their way a behavior that is antithetical to what this country and its representative system is all about You are barely a liberal anymore and most likely belong with us because you seem to share a lot of the same viewpoints as present day conservatives and not with vocal liberals disdain for SJWs disillusionment with liberals uniting ,conservative

This is already law Part of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act https en wikipedia org wiki Personal_Responsibility_and_Work_Opportunity_Act Immigrant_welfare signed by Bill Clinton in 1996 A lesser known provision of PRWORA made immigrants entering the United States ineligible for federal welfare funds for five years after arriving in the United States ,conservative
As someone on the left my first reaction was that I totally support this idea which doesn t happen often with Trump s plans I can t say I was too surprised to see it was already law It seems a lot of immigration problems could be fixed by enforcing the laws already on the books ,conservative
I thought this was already the current law Is he just trolling the left at this point Getting them to call his proposed changes racist sexist xenophobic and then point out it s already a law signed by a Democrat ,conservative
This is already the law since 1996 ,conservative
Wow trump taking credit for other people s work how surprising ,conservative
As someone who went through the immigration system I can tell you that this is already law and yes it is already enforced It sounds like Trump may be signing a largely symbolic bill that has no practical impact Even the original law passed by Bill Clinton was largely symbolic Immigrating to the US is expensive and the only common ways in require existing family to sponsor you or a skilled job with a sponsoring employer There were never many immigrants coming in who would have qualified for or needed welfare in the first place As a plan it seems to contradict his other statements on immigration How can there simultaneously be a crisis with immigrants taking too many jobs and also requiring welfare ,conservative

My parents came to this country from Venezuela when I was 3 years old and they were in their mid 20s They won a student lottery to study at IUPUI The only reason we were able to have an easy enough life was because of food stamps My Parents would use their food stamps and then buy food stamps at a lower rate with cash from other people Americans of a specific class and race Why are you trying to punish people who come to the country and work and produce Why not punish people who don t produce regardless of who they are Legally immigrating is already hard enough but some government welfare programs like food stamps are only helpful Now they re highly successful dentists that put way more into the economy then they ever received The government invested in my family and it paid off That s how it s supposed to work ,conservative

Compared to what you got under Bush Sr as benefits welfare no longer is a hand up but is so crippled that it only holds you down so I think we should get rid of it completely now All Americas blight will be in the light of day for all to see ,conservative
Any immigrant coming here heavy with child will have that unborn anchor baby immediately registered by authorities and then generous welfare payments will begin to flow before it has drawn its first foreign breath Welfare is a massive spendy thing that sprinkles copious rain on both citizen and illegal alien alike as if both were standing in the same shower Shared Social Security numbers bought by immigrants will afford these alien any bonus benefit not freely gifted and another SSN will potentially double that ,conservative
Sounds incredibly difficult to actually enforce however having a point system like Canada has to mitigate this would go a long way in making sure people coming here are a net benefit to the US and that they can support themselves ,conservative

I watched this short documentary recently about how some Swedish schools are gender neutral that is they don t reinforce typical gender roles and mannerisms and just let the kids do what they want I thought that was a good start but it almost seemed like they were shunning gender norms They had no toys that were gendered barbie dolls tonka trucks for example and instead had gender neutral things like bland looking dolls and wooden blocks Honestly to me I don t see why it s so bad that children can be taught that other gender identities are ok as well as the masculine feminine norm is ok too I think kids are just too young to really understand that but at the same time why not just let them do as they please If a girl wants Batman action figures so be it and if a boy wants Barbies well why not Is there a real downside to a child being happy Now of course if parents are forcing alternate gender identities on their kids because they hate heteronormativity then that is indeed abuse But not,conservative

Trans people like all of us can choose their gender identity as much as homosexuals can choose their sexual orientation It just so happen that sometimes the brain lands in the wrong body and what we want to teach them is that it s ok to change the body because it s impossible to change the brain We can t cure somebody s gender identity like we can t cure homosexuality the only cure that has shown to work is acceptance ,conservative

Well color me surprised The Pope and I actually agree on something Religion aside I don t think we should be providing mental scarring to children with liberal social justice and fad cultural trends There was once a time in this nation where kids were allowed to be kids and have fun as kids and not be embroiled in the hysterical matters of adults and their politics Can t we all just admit that child abuse in any form is wrong and work against it ,conservative

Trump and Hillary aren t president yet so both those fuckers will say they are perfectly healthy until one of thems slides into our country s DMs ,conservative
I totally agree with this but it should be a priority during the primaries I mean if anything came out that would affect the public s perception of a candidates health ability to do the job it would be a major crisis for that party We have an example of this with Michael Dukakis in 1988 when Reagan went proto Trumpian by calling him an invalid The fact is there are two major nominees who are senior citizens and primary voters were ok with this though maybe Dems didn t get a real choice in the matter ,conservative

No one disputes that he is the president though many wish he were not That said the notmypresident is a mirror of the same statements and sentiments expressed for all 8 years of President Obama by conservatives and Fox News pundits To demand many liberals to stop protesting a president who they feel is inadequate and dangerous simply because he is president ignores the behavior of many conservatives the past 8 years and their constitutional right to protest and voice their opinion It also does nothing to end the partisan bickering or to show them respect as human beings Full disclosure I am liberal on many issues and I voted for Obama though Palin was the deciding factor in that vote I do not like Trump and I don t like Pence either because I feel he doesn t represent the smaller government ideals I like about conservatism ,conservative

This is absolutely baffling to me I may not 100 agree with some of the finer points of the original memo but the overall message was don t silence opposition be it political opinion ideology And then Google takes the most extreme approach and permanently silences him from the workplace They literally proved his point if you have a different opinion than the majority be silent or be removed AKA the exact opposite of diversity So I assume Google fired this person because they thought he was a bad person because of his opinions but that is just Google s opinion of him and his ideologies Much akin to the bakery refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding shouldn t the same argument be applied here There s no law that states his opinion is wrong just a counter ideology Firing him is one step closer to thought police and is practiced bigotry ,conservative
I m not trolling here but help me clarify my argument in relation to this Google firing and the Colin Kaepernick situation I believe Kaepernick has hurt his job prospects by being an outspoken activist while on the job He s not getting contract offers because he s attempting to draw attention to himself and his cause when in essence he should just be playing football to the best of his ability Now the Google employee gets fired for speaking out against what he feels are problems within his workplace while on the job that brings undue attention to his employer Am I wrong in thinking both have brought this on themselves and while each can protest to their hearts content on their own time once they connected the activism to their jobs they ve created their own fate ,conservative

I agree with you Jeb Bush running is a stupid idea It does not matter what is political views are many people see the name Bush and assume he will be like his brother and father I think we need to get away from candidates with the last name Bush or Clinton ,conservative

BLM is actually a misnomer There are two general groups in BLM There are the ones who want respect and there are the ones who want to kill the white man In between there are grays like those who wants to kill the white cops and the blacks in collusion with them If they really were concerned about black lives they would be concentrating on those who are killing the most black lives by far black men ,conservative

Upvoted for visability from a liberal btw ,conservative
Alt Right is definitely more big government with a focus towards ethnocentrism It is also an identitarian movement Everything conservatives disagree with the left on the alt right has in some form ,conservative
One thing I ve noticed in media reporting is that liberals talk about the alt right as if it makes up the majority of conservatives when in reality they are a sliver of the whole the estranged cousin that isn t invited to family gatherings but still believes he s part of the family By doing this we further polarize politics Just look at Reddit I see alt right on the front page a few times a day but rarely anything about real conservatives edit I m glad my comment created some good debate At the end of the day remember both parties are guilty of picking the most radical out of the other side and portraying their traits on the whole of the party liberals target the alt right and conservatives currently enjoy teasing young liberal millennials ,conservative
I have to say as an outsider in Europe though with ties to America the American conservatives seem to have a real issue when it comes to distancing themselves from these guys I used to think it was just the media trying to make conservatism look bad but more conservative people in my own family are now spouting the dangerous nonsense and defending the actions of these vile people update been banned because my ignorant outsider opinion isn t wanted so can t reply to anyone Sorry ,conservative

Every person that is alt right considers themselves a conservative We are not confused They are directly related ,conservative
Identity Politics always leads to violence Identity Politics and proto Identity Politics leads to things like the Know Nothing Party the KKK Eugenics The White Man s Burden Slavery and tribalism Republicans and Conservatives have always been against Identity Politics and we would be smart to remind the nation that we stand against Identity Politics White Supremacists are not welcome here ,conservative
The confusion is unsurprising when the Trump administration collectively downplays right wing extremism and militancy Any blindspot is a hazard for national security defense There s no excuse and it needlessly harms conservative credibility Extremism must be ruthlessly confronted and wiped out wherever it manifests be it related to Islamic fundamentalism or a traitorous group that proudly marches with Nazi flags ,conservative

Chicago and thus every MSM outlet who reports this is denying there were any racial or political motivations for this assault If they refuse to bring the proper hate crime charges on this case the department needs to be shut down and their leadership jailed for aiding and abetting terrorists ,conservative
I would like to make it abundantly clear that absolutely no sane person on either side of the political spectrum is supporting or condoning this unbelievably heinous act This is without a doubt a travesty and the perpetrators involved should be dealt with to the fullest extent of the law All of us agree in this regard This is not a partisan issue this the probably the most horrible thing all of us have seen all week ,conservative

I m not sure I understand what s even being said here ,conservative
The problem is that the constitution was written over two hundred years ago so what the founders thought at the time isn t completely relevant to today s world When the founders gave the right to keep and bear arms did they mean weapons of mass destruction They didn t exist at the time What about semi automatic rifles which also didn t exist When the founders said In suits at common law where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars the right of trial by jury shall be preserved did they mean to adjust the 20 limit with inflation When the founders said The right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated Did they mean to prevent the interception and search of data transferred over the internet even though it s not in the person house paper or effects The constitution can t be taken literally any more than the Bible can We must interpret with today s world ,conservative

A disclaimer I m fairly moderate and don t like Trump and think Obama is more or less okay I come here because I m genuinely interested in what you guys feel about what s going on Here are some of my thoughts on the points brought up here 1 I actually really think Fast and Furious should have gotten much more attention and he definitely tried to dodge blame on that one Yeah the president deals with a lot and doesn t get everything right but he s in charge and should be accountable for that one For this reason I would agree that his presidency isn t scandal free 2 Benghazi is a touchy issue and there s so much political spin from both dems and republicans on this that I have no idea what to think about it It was clearly a mistake by the administration but I m not sure it qualifies as a scandal though I could be wrong To me personally it s a tragedy but not one I completely pin on Obama Terrorism is a tricky thing and it feels like there s hardly any space for nuanced discussion when it ,conservative
It s ok Liberals freaked out about Trump s comments about concession but have no issue at all with boycotting the peaceful transition of power ,conservative
You re not supposed to be sycophants you re supposed to be skeptics Obama said to the sycophantic reporters he has often cussed and criticized and belittled for hyping his scandals and hopscotching from one love story to the next Obama love story too quickly You re not supposed to be complimentary to people other than me but you re supposed to cast a critical eye on folks not me who hold enormous power and make sure that they not me are helf accountable to the people who sent me here like a god king Something tells me the misty eyed messiah mainstream media who failed at scandal discovery over the last eight years will suddenly discover presidential scandals everywhere in the new administration ,conservative
Being crazy gives him leverage in negotiations We better do what he says he s crazy He knows that nobody wants to get into a nuclear war Others could be drawn into it and nobody would like the fallout ,conservative
The sad thing is that Kim Jon un is absolutely right Having a nuke really is checkmate It only takes one and the willingness to use it to be an effective deterrent ,conservative
It s not necessarily craziness it s propaganda to his own people who don t know any better In the past North Korea has been able to say and do whatever they wanted because the presidents just gave them all a free pass The media and governments of the world have fostered this idea of nah just let them which is why Kim Jong un is so willing to challenge the US and act like a hero for his people There s been no consequences in the past for that behavior ,conservative
It only takes one Having more isn t necessarily an advantage ,conservative
This caricature presents a rather ignorant and frankly stupidly simplistic way to look at the problem at hand Let s say it is exactly like in the picture and the US have enough Nukes to nukes the whole country into oblivion and NK single nuke would only get New York eradicated Sure if you compare numbers the US only lose 8 5 Million people while NK loses 25 Millions But this is no number game Losing 8 5 people in any way IS a lost war no matter what you did to the opposition This is the reason why the most important thing is to prevent Nukes in the first place Edit thx u dioandeyes18 ,conservative

It will be more of a problem for the South Koreans ,conservative
Well it only takes one nuke really ,conservative
North Korea is like the Mouse that Roared They know they can t win in a war however they are betting with their nuclear threats they can goad the West into giving them things In the past it was the threat of making nuclear weapons and now it is the threat of using them It has worked for decades but sadly for the DPRK the White House is under new management and is taking a much harder stance So they resort to more insults to save face but nothing will actually come of it While the majority of North Koreans are brainwashed and believe that their country is the greatest thing in the world and can defeat all threats Kim Jong Un was educated in Europe and has to know understand the true position North Korea is in And he wants to keep power so he won t do much but make idle threats and test ICBM s to try and scare the West into giving them things ,conservative
If anyone attacks the Norks Seoul would cease to exist rather quickly So more of a stale mate maybe ,conservative
China and Russia s nukes must be out of the frame ,conservative
The real checkmate is the DPRK s massive collection of conventional weapons that are within range of Seoul South Korea It s difficult to imagine a militaristic move against North Korea that wouldn t result in them reacting by bombing Seoul and claiming potentially hundreds of thousands of casualties before everything was contained That is the one if the biggest factors in delaying American military action ,conservative
kim jong un is evil but he s not crazy he loves the fact that he can bully countries like the US and China while having 1 1 000 000 of the power ,conservative
Just as an aside it is this kind of downplaying of the DPRK s nuclear capabilities which has allowed him to achieve his current position ,conservative
Well if he manages to hit a place with that nuke it will make it uninhabitable for generations not to mention the immediate casualties Even if we wiped North Korea off the map with nukes which isn t really feasible because of the proximity to our ally South Korea we would still have a radioactive zone somewhere with a large population ,conservative
He s not crazy He s got exactly what he wants Returned threats that he can show off to his people in a vacuum to claim that the Unites States is bringing fire and fury at any moment Anytime we so much as move a ship he says we ll all burn in apocalyptic fire and he does it by design The entire NK population is raised from childhood to believe that the only reason they struggle is US aggression so anytime his leadership is frayed he provokes a response from the US spins his provacation and touts the response as evidence of our imperialism So that s not proof that he s crazy It s proof that if he s even sitting at the table he s already won ,conservative
just one persons opinion he s only crazy if he actually expects to win i don t believe that he does he can t he may not be too smart but he isn t fucking retarded he cannot possibly expect to win however you want to define that if he actually believed the propaganda he spewed he would ve been bolstered by his delusions into attacking long before now so then the logical i know reason for his actions is that he just wants the world to watch him get that first suckerpunch in and laugh his ass off as we rain hellfire down on him that is his victory the history that states the great NK peoples were powerful enough to bloody the nose of those big bad wolves from the west and badass enough to just stand there with their heads held high as they are wiped off the face of the fucking earth in that way you wouldn t be able to think talk about one without also talking about the other as long as the USA exists so too would the memory of NK similar to how you can t talk about WWII USA without thinki,conservative

No no no not those poor and underprivileged They don t vote the way I do ,conservative
It s like Hugo Chavez using his for now idiom when he lost a referendum He was for the people whether they liked it or not No amount of poverty would demonstrate that his policies were bad because they were done out of love for the people ,conservative
It s just like when people say hurricanes and droughts are racist No they re classist They affect poor people equally whether you re white or black or whatever ,conservative
One of the things that annoys me about this is that it s typically said by people who pride themselves on voting against their own economic self interest i e upper middle class liberals progressives So as I often point out to them they see themselves as noble for rising above economic self interest to vote on principle but seem to have such contempt for poor and minority conservatives that they never even consider the possibility that they re doing the same thing For example some of them oppose abortion and so vote against Dems on principle even though they d likely be better off financially with Dems in office tl dr I am noble for voting against my self interest you are stupid for doing so ,conservative
They equate underprivileged with their oppression ladder See whites are on the bottom of the oppression ladder So they can t be underprivileged So the left doesn t care about them ,conservative
I explained this to my extremely intelligent but not very politically informed sisters after the election When you re poor everything else comes second to survival We have an interesting family dynamic grew up in Central PA our late father was a family doctor who grew up the son of a poor alcoholic coal miner Despite his profession he never golfed a day in his life and would regularly make house calls after hunting or fishing to see poor and sick patients who paid him in firewood or venison as often as money I m blessed to say we were decently well off and all ended up relocating to philly for school One sis is a MD the other a D Psych both in the city Having seen all sides of the spectrum namely white and black poverty they accept that the urban poor have a ton more in common with the rural and suburban retards than they do a limousine liberal regardless of skin color ,conservative

I m a fully grown adult and I still think trannies are not only weird but downright nasty They make me uncomfortable because they are the embodiment of walking severe mental illness ,conservative
While I agree with certain ideas the fundamental premise of his titular argument is mistaken Much of the world is much more binary about gender in adulthood but much less so than the US in childhood They don t worry about little boys in the lady s room or little girls in the men s room or about the cloths their kids wear until they start school the way we do in the US In a lot of the world it s also not weird at all for little boys to wear dresses This is a bit nasty but there are practical reasons like letting small children poop anywhere without risk of diaper rash Boys wearing frills and ribbons was also totally normal in the US until recently see white tie and is still normal outside of the US Incidentally in western society we also used to believe like Freud that children weren t aware of sexual dimorphism or gender roles until a certain point in their sexual development Both the idea of a gender deviant child and a gender creative child are probably harmful modern impositions on ,conservative
So this thread got brigaded hard by the SJWs ,conservative
Part of being conservative is not butting your nose into other people s business This post idea goes against that If some guy wants to be a girl Cool And Vice Versa I don t have to do that They arn t forcing me to do that And they arn t forcing children to do that Cool It literally has ZERO impact on my life So why would I judge them I don t want to be judged for the things I do especially the things that are personal and have no impact on other people ,conservative
Depends what you mean when you say react accordingly My reaction to people I find weird or people I find normal is to be kind and respectful until they show me they don t deserve it ,conservative
It s just clothes ,conservative
I didn t catch the age of this cross dressing gender creative child but I can only assume that really this kid is just being told what to wear by his parents Literally his struggles are because of his parents That s my thought ,conservative
You re right I shouldn t blame your kid I should blame you for your intolerance and passing it on to your kid ,conservative
Sex is a biological fact gender is a social construct So if your kid thinks that clothes is weird because gender is biology you re probably either doing a poor job explaining science to your child or their child is awful ,conservative
This article was better than I was expecting based on the title Could have been called Don t blame my autistic kid for thinking your cross dressing kid is weird As the article starts out saying the guy s kid is overly concerned with rules about how the world should be and makes a fuss when things don t fall into his predefined categories While the kid with autism is pretty clearly ascribing too much authority to his preconceptions I don t think it s unfair to ask if his dad is doing the same to a smaller extent There s no law to my knowledge dictating how we respond to deviating behaviors and just because it s easy to call deviators deviants must we I get that we can expect no better of anyone I just don t see the point of recognizing that as reality when we might make things better by trying to change it since we re clearly not going to get rid of weird behavior ,conservative
weird o ˈwirdō nouninformal noun weirdo plural noun weirdos a person whose dress or behavior seems strange or eccentric ,conservative
It s not a mood It s not a feeling It s genetic binary and definite This has scientifically been proven wrong Gender is an incredibly complex thing So is sexuality However 99 of the population really ARE just girls or boys What is it like 5 of all people that are gay Then there s a shitload of psychological problems on top of all this Kids are kids and will make believe about anything As an adult you correct them You can t always give them what you want you gotta give them what they need Because you re the parent the adult you re there to raise them and help them in their life Same thing goes for gender male or female Let em have some fun But then you raise them to be functional adults How is a 5 year old to know what s best for him or her He s 5 He wants to eat candy all day Come on And if for some reason they turn out to be that 1 or it turns out they re gay that s fine You love and accept them for what they are Because you re their parent Edit Added an s ,conservative
Seriously what kind of a fuckin weirdo worries about what kind of clothes other people are wearing Maybe they have that complex where they think they re Napoleon but in this case it s Joan Rivers Sounds pretty weird to me ,conservative

The title is begging for controversy but otherwise it s reasonably solid ,conservative
The transgender and gender identity ideology really brings out the stupid from all sides of the spectrum This whole comments section is one big cringe fest There are real social consequences for breaking social norms and social conventions You are free to present yourself according to your own preferences and you are free to change your presentation in order to change how you are perceived If nobody s forcing you to dress like a buffoon then you cannot complain when others treat you accordingly ,conservative

The reason that they rule of law expands is because someone does something so negligent or so unethical that the rule of law must become larger to cover it Although this cartoon is of course aimed at the echo chamber it should also spark some debate on how large of an umbrella the rule of law should caste should we wish for a smaller government If we are to continue to delegate certain actions to government and concede rights to government in order to make that happen where do we draw the line ,conservative

It is absolutely amazing how deluded and ignorant the people over at r politics can be This same video was posted there and rather than be concerned about a CNN producer laughing at the idea of ethics in their reporting they instead claim that Okeefe only makes fake news They are burying their heads so far in the sand that they will deny video and audio evidence that couldn t possibly be taken out of context and merely attack the source not to mention that their favorite video against Trump the Billy Bush grab em by the pussy video is exactly the same type of video ,conservative

While I must admit I am generally liberal even I have to say all the Trump Russia collusion stories are getting old to see Do I think some of the things that are reported and some of Trump s own actions and statements seem a little sketchy Sure But ultimately that s why there is currently some sort of investigation going on I don t need to hear about it every day because at this point there really isn t too much more to report and to be honest it just takes away from actually debating the policies that are being put out especially health care currently If something comes up in the future from this investigation or otherwise sure let s bring it up again and discuss it but unless until something like that occurs I would rather see more talk about policies ,conservative
I take it this won t be on r news ,conservative

Bernie Bro turned Dr Jill voter here and even I can see Donald Trump won fair and square This was the year of the progressive candidates It s what the people wanted Both Bernie and Donald switched parties to join the duopoly because each believed strongly in their message On the democratic ticket the nomination was admittedly rigged from the beginning leaked emails and DWS s own words against Bernie Sanders But on the republican ticket Donald Trump stood on stage with a dozen other candidates and was the last man standing Whether he called other candidates names or made grandiose promises doesn t matter He spoke to a base that wanted what he represents Like Bernie his new found party didn t want him but the people spoke And so Mr Trump will be our next POTUS I want America to succeed and I support him He starts with a clean slate I have no reason to hate on him yet Why Because of what a crooked MSM says Fuck them And as for those assholes that beat that guy up come on man That s bullsh,conservative

Fucking A The protests are a goddamn embarrassment You don t like how the general turned out Then you should have supported the candidate who wasn t buried under a thousand scandals and under fucking FBI investigation in the primary The candidate who never attacked Her when the DNC and his opponent were obviously conspiring against him as WikiLeaks has now proven but just stuck to the issues The candidate who didn t feel entitled to the presidency who had no ego who put people before personal advancement and power Where the hell were you when your voice might have actually made a difference Oh that s right You were With Her Pfft ,conservative

For all the people arguing that Clinton won the popular vote and that the Electoral College is again an outdated anachronism I just want to point out One of the reasons for the Electoral College is so that in a tight election the President is elected based on not just a simple popular vote but to more closely reflect the will of voters from every state in the country If the President was elected only on the popular vote then many states with smaller populations and only 3 or 4 electoral votes would be completely ignored in future Presidential elections Also some states distribute their electoral votes in proportion to the popular vote But others do not For example Hillary got all 56 electoral college votes from California but she did not get 100 of the individual votes ,conservative

WHY TIM KAINE OK so we all know Debbie Wasserman Schultz DWS was the co chair of Hillary s 2008 presidential run where she lost the nomination to Obama So in order to lock down the nomination for 2016 Hillary was able to get DWS in charge of the DNC and manipulate it from within That s the theory anyway except In order for this to work they would first have to not only get the DNC chair to step down but also get them to recommend DWS for the position The Clinton s would have to promise something to that person something more prestigious than being head of the Democratic party So who was that person and what did they get in return It would appear that Donna Brazile was in line to get the position but she was only the interim chair after the previous chair left served only one month According to this http rulers org usgovt html parties the previous chair of the DNC prior to DWS was Tim Kaine Thanks to proudcanadian3410875 for the comment ,conservative

I dont envy you Americans Its dissapointing that Sanders has had to endorse a snake I know some of you will probably vote Trump purely to spite Clinton I would too I don t believe she deserves to hold the most powerful political position in the world I don t believe she has any capability as a foreign diplomat she can t even run a private server properly How anyone can even justify voting for her boggles the mind How the American justice system found her innocent of any crime boggles the mind ,conservative
Here s the thing that s missing People don t just hand out classified information someone had to say it was okay to send it to her knowing her situation and if they didn t that s even a bigger problem I don t think it so much that Clinton has all this power over the US govt as much as if they admit she did something wrong then the FBI NSA CIA and other alphabet soup agencies need to answer the question why did you send her classified e mails knowing they were going to a vulnerable server Welcome to cover your ass government ,conservative
If you think about it he may be on our side If he did charge her Obama would just use his power to forgive her So he just gave all that is needed for someone who can convict her without Obama stepping in Just a thought ,conservative

This article confuses me Statutory rape is a strict liability crime which pretty much means if you have sex with an underage person you are guilty regardless of intent excuse or consent It s like a speeding ticket doesn t matter if you knew didn t know you were speeding the cop just gives you a ticket I m confused because it should t matter whether or not she liked older men or whatever that bullshit is It s almost impossible to be acquitted of statutory rape so I think there s some other stuff going on that the article doesn t disclose I am in no way a Hillary supporter just confused about the case ,conservative
This is one of the rare times where I ve read that she actually did her job well ,conservative
Attorney here the following quote from the article hits the nail on the head As an attorney and an officer of the court she had an ethical and legal obligation to defend him to the fullest extent of the law To act otherwise would have constituted a breach of her professional responsibilities Not a Clinton supporter but her job was to defend the guy the prosecutor should have done a better job ,conservative
So a defense attorney discredited a key witness for the plaintiff So she did her job ,conservative
Hillary is an evil wretch ,conservative
My mom didn t believe me when I told her about this She still doesn t ,conservative
I m not a huge fan of Hillary but this is just ridiculous She was a public defender forced to take this case and she defended her client to the best of her ability There is no conspiracy to cover this up You can t ask the victim of the rape to objectively judge the defense attorney assigned to defend her attacker This is not news It s just inflammatory nonsense in an election year What you all should be focusing on is her illegal use of the email server That s pretty much the ONLY valid argument against her right now Other shit just makes this sub seem like a bunch of Donald Trump supporters and tinfoil hat conspiracy theorists ,conservative
wish you guys would focus on something other than this and that photoshopped Robert Byrd pic there s like 50 other creepy things about her that can actually hurt her in the election this crap will not She was a defense attorney in her first criminal case in 1975 In the end prosecutors offered her client a plea deal and he served a year in prison good luck making a scandal out of her doing her job exactly the same way all other defense attorneys do theirs You all DO realise that heinous rapists and serial killers have lawyers trying to prove them not guilty right might want to lobby to change our system to something from Iran or Somalia if that bothers you ,conservative
I hate her but she was a defense attorney it s what she s supposed to do ,conservative
This statement The Daily Beast agreed to withhold her name out of concern for her privacy as a victim of sexual assault Seems to be at odds with this statement The victim said if she saw Clinton today she would call her out for what she sees as the hypocrisy of Clinton s current campaign to fight for women s rights compared to her actions regarding this rape case so long ago ,conservative
Ambulance chasers are legal too They re still mostly scumbags I wouldn t want to be anywhere near let alone leading the free world This is exactly Hillary s core issue Legal moral ethical As long as she thinks she s technically legal she ll leverage it every way she can Laundering money through strong arming the state parties is an example Hugely increasing arms sales to Saudi Arabia while Bill collects millions to the Clinton Foundation is another All legal all horribly unethical And her supporters make excuses for it even lauding her for it It s disgusting ,conservative

Insider trading requires foreknowledge of action on the information and Clinton had no reason to suspect that her son and law would act on or even find out about such information ,conservative

I would sign this but I don t want to die ,conservative
How much will this Internet petition do ,conservative
With her clear health concerns to boot it really shouldn t even be in doubt at this point ,conservative
She won t See I m a Trump supporter so I m of two minds on this one On one hand I don t want her president especially considering she ll just hand out presidential power due to her health On the other hand I really want Trump to win and he has a far better chance against her than Bernie But I also don t really mind Bernie nearly as much as Hillary So Idk ,conservative
She can t ,conservative
Well would he even be eligible after she has the nomination ,conservative
Procedurally the DNC would elect a new nominee if she did drop out My guess is that they would elect someone like Biden not Bernie That s what I think would happen Bernie would just get screwed again ,conservative
It sucks Sanders had his chance to stand up for what he believed in and sold out Who knows why if you re a conspiracy theorist perhaps it was to protect his family Perhaps But for someone who galvanized so many people to wither when he should have stood up for the principles he espoused that s someone who turned his back on the very people who made him relevant ,conservative
She cannot afford to lose She owes too much to too many ruthless people In the words of Marquise de Merteuil I consulted the strictest moralists to learn how to appear philosophers to find out what to think and novelists to see what I could get away with And in the end I distilled everything to one wonderfully simple principle win or die ,conservative

Its pathetic at this point Lie to cover lie Nobody not even her supporters have an argument anymore All we can do is sit on the sidelines and watch This is what the US has become ,conservative
Is it even possible for a candidate to be changed Doesn t each state have different requirements for getting a Presidential candidate on the ballot Independent and 3rd party candidates have to struggle to get their names on the ballot If the Democrats changed their candidate at this point would it be too late If Hillary drops dead a week before the election I expect the election to proceed as usual There have been plenty of elections not Presidential where a candidate has died before the election but still won the election If this happened then Kaine would become the President and could appoint anyone he wants to be vice President ,conservative
I d love for him to get the nomination but that doesn t mean I hope she is in pain or dead That d make me no better than her I hope she pulls out and recovers fully Then she can fuck off ,conservative
I m a Trump supporter I don t much care for Bernie to be frank I think he s not what we need in many ways But despite all of this he is lightyears more qualified to be president than Hillary If he were to be on the ticket I think he d win by a landslide Period Even a lot of hardcore Trump supporters would switch to him because many of us were once Bernie supporters I liked him at the start but knew he d never win He reeked of Nader esque merit ,conservative
deleted ,conservative
Of course she should Doesn t mean she will What really surprised me was that she didn t at least pick him as her running mate now she s in such an irredeemably poor state with all the corruption and health issues and her general personality and the only things she has going for her is followers that largely don t care and a censorship machine to block out anything that might cause them to Hillary is running on woman highlighting negatives about her opponent hiding her own negatives at all costs She absolutely will not win based on any pros just a razor thin contest in appearing to be the lesser evil The Democratic Nominee cannot clearly widely make Donald Trump of all people seem worse ,conservative
As a trump supporter please Id like this to actually be a fair race of ideals rather than trump running against a power hungry criminal who gets nothing but love from the media Edit looks like I m being downvoted by shills You need to try harder hillaretards ,conservative
She is fucked People don t understand how fucked she is Either she is in for perjury or she has to change the story she told the FBI Trapped between a rock and a hard place ,conservative
Fortunately for Hillary perjury is something the Clintons know how to deal with ,conservative
Have you ever read about any of the astonishingly corrupt politicians and political machines we ve had in the past like Boss Tweed and Tammany Hall Or Dick Cheney bringing in private for profit firms Enron among them to meet in secret to decide the country s energy policy Or Haliburton which Cheney was on the board of directors of being given no bid contracts worth tens of billions of dollars to manage the Iraq war History is repeating itself because we don t remember shit ,conservative

Ouch I see a heart attack in his future Down and elevator shaft falling into some bullets ,conservative
We fuckin have it on video Why the fuck are the FBI not knocking on her door with handcuffs ready is beyond me ,conservative
I can tell you right now she s not going to go to jail for this definitely not before the election is over and she won t be pushed out of the running either I d bet 20 on it ,conservative
First off people are making the mistake that the FBI wants to let Hillary go free They were likely forced to make that decision what they did do however is throw gas on the fire of public opinion that might just be what they need for a perjury trial which would be far easier to prove in this case ,conservative
Could we please stop with all of the it s never gonna happen she ll go free Clinton will be POTUS because corruption shit This cynical apathy circlejerk is diminishing our efforts Ever heard of a self fulfilling prophecy Seriously just contribute to the discussion in some way or shut up ,conservative
So she either goes to jail to perjury or has to change her story and go to jail for the original investigation On top of all the other investigations and the Clinton foundation How the fuck have the DNC not dropper her yet ,conservative
I must be watching reading the wrong things Are the conservatives not up in arms over this in DC They have so much shit on her they should be having a field day in the media ,conservative
Serious question how do we as normal citizens push this issue She committed a felony There is sufficient evidence How can we push to have warrants filed ,conservative
This was the plan the whole time ,conservative
I wonder how fast either trump or Hillary will get assassinated after they win someone should start a count down timer ,conservative

I posted this in another comment so I will re post it here Shit never happened to Dick Cheney over project Stellar Wind Enron or Halliburton and no bid contracts Nothing is going to happen to Clinton over her email server FBI Tell me something that will implicate someone in a crime William Binney So I told them what the crime was that I knew about and that was George Bush Dick Cheney Tenet and Haden conspired to subvert the constitution the constitutional process and any number of laws and here s how they did it I explained Stellar Wind on my back porch to all the FBI agents who weren t cleared So they had a problem I created a problem for them because they had a bunch of people now that weren t cleared for a very highly classified only because it was domestic spying by the way was the reason why it was highly classified They wanted to highly classify the extreme impeachable crimes that they were committing If you re interested in what else Binney had to say you should watch the New Yo,conservative
How is Comey to prove she had intent to lie I wouldn t get our hopes up over this ,conservative
lmfao the top comment She is fucked People don t understand how fucked she is I don t think you guys understand how fucked our government is She ll walk away run for president and win What can we do to prevent this Nothing ,conservative
Who hires and fires the FBI guy Can Trump fire his ass if he becomes POTUS ,conservative
They ll just say in other circumstances we d prosecute but that s not the direction we re going in this case I d love to see her in prison but if she got off once she can do it again unfortunately ,conservative

So what are the chances of something actually happening due to this I feel like there will be talk about this but nothing will happen and she ll still become the next President ,conservative
Really good article and I agree she broke the law JORDAN But I m asking how I m asking how it was done Was did someone physically look at the 62 000 e mails or did you use search terms date parameters I want to know the specifics CLINTON They did all of that and I did not look over their shoulders because I thought it would be appropriate for them to conduct that search and they did I m sort of concerned because her answer doesn t really make it seem like she knows what they did She might be able to say that s just how I imagined they would do it ,conservative

removed ,conservative
These two situations were different in about a hundred different ways Also Nixon wasn t impeached I m no Hillary fan but pulling direct comparisons out of your ass doesn t help anyone ,conservative
Ok so your assertion is wrong on so many levels but let s just make a few things clear First Nixon wasn t impeached Second an impeachment is an indictment not a conviction Much like a grand jury may vote to indict it doesn t mean you re guilty there s still a trial Third the letters of impeachment were initiated on the ground of obstruction of justice because Nixon refused to hand over the White House tapes and other subpoenaed evidence not because he subsequently destroyed it You know history yeah If you do then you re purposely misleading with this post to further an agenda If you don t then you should learn it and not speak from a place of ignorance just to further an agenda ,conservative

Nixon wasn t ever impeached He resigned prior to that ever happening ,conservative
Dirty politics She s corrupting media and elections trading favors for appointments and government favoritism Plain and simple ,conservative
Nixon got reelected during Watergate ,conservative
History shows that every attempt at organizing people matures into a tyrannical regime with absolute power concentrated in just a handful of individuals who are above and separate from everyone else This is true now in Saudia Arabia and North Korea and the vast majority of the population suffers as a result We are simply maturing into this stage of democracy At this point literally all the evidence we need is there The final indicator for me that she is being crowned was when Obama announced that the emails would not be released until after the election It was his turn 8 years ago and it is her turn now and he s in on it and so is everyone else and what s worse is that we can see everything It s abysmal that people ignore this and I can t even speak about it with friends and family because it s uncomfortable for them to talk about it So that s how it happens ,conservative

Assange is not only a hero to the American people but a hero to the greater portion of the world The fact that she would even consider ending his life is an attack on free speech and the freedom of expression as well as everything else we as Americans hold dear But it doesn t end there The method of assassination she wants for Assange would likely start a war or at least fuel strong hatred for the American government throughout Europe South America particularly Ecuador and with the American people themselves She is not qualified nor does she have the temperament to by a leader never mind Commander in Chief ,conservative

Even if it is a joke like Hillary supporters are claiming is this something for someone with the capabilities to actually carry this out to joke about Anyway it s pretty clear this isn t a joke since the paragraph mentions how serious she was about it I don t understand how someone so irresponsible as to want to bomb an EMBASSY in fucking LONDON ENGLAND is fit to be president More so how dumbass Hillary supporters can prance around acting like they have high ground when they are backing the most dangerous candidate for president in this country s history I have little faith the press will cover this but hopefully it gets plenty of exposure on social media and Reddit I remember when something like this would be front page news but that was before the media sold out to the highest bidder ,conservative

Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said the State Department must keep politics out of the process as it works on the messages and said speed is important He said the State department has had the 14 900 messages for a month and hasn t produced any of them yet That s simply not acceptable he said The 14 900 emails are on one computer disk All told the FBI turned over seven disks It s not entirely clear what documents are on the others The FBI said the 14 900 emails on disk one were either sent or received by Mrs Clinton and are not duplicative of the approximately 30 000 emails she turned over and that the State Department already released under a judge s order ,conservative

The scathing audit of Hillary Clinton s use of a basement email server while secretary of state gives cover to the FBI chief as he weighs whether to push for an indictment against the Democratic presidential front runner The 82 page report leaked yesterday which found Clinton s hard drive at her New York home broke federal standards and left sensitive material vulnerable to hackers makes FBI Director James Comey s recommendation to Attorney General Loretta Lynch that much easier said GOP consultant Brad Marston It gives Comey additional cover Marston said and makes it easier for the FBI to recommend to the Justice Department to pursue an indictment Republican strategist Ford O Connell said the report helps the FBI s decision by establishing whether Clinton s server was attacked by hackers and whether the former secretary of state did keep all her emails on the server If you re a neutral arbiter like James Comey you have to say Hats off There s actual proof O Connell said It gives him c,conservative
I wish people would make this case a lot clearer by explaining it by comparing it to Hillary having secret documents or secret weapons laying around her house I don t think the meh I share everything generation can really internalize the huge risk and damage she did to America This isn t a matter of that it was discovered before it became a risk A foreign entity and probably several hacked into the email servers and stole state secrets she kept out in the open She has absolutely no comprehension for the reality and risk of what she did ,conservative

I don t want to take any seriousness away from mishandling classified information and ignoring regulations but for all the shit the Clinton s have pulled it s kind of funny if this is what brings her down Like Al Capone going to jail for tax evasion I guess people get so used to getting away with major crimes like murder and treason they think they are untouchable and ignore the mundane crimes they commit ,conservative
I m okay if it drags out past the Democrat convention It will put the DOJ the crooked Democrat party Obama and Hillary all look like the criminal outfit that they are if the FBI recommends to indite the lying bitch Her aides have now been interviewed which means in a few days Hillary will be interviewed It s gone on for so long I m okay with the FBI dragging it out a little further if they are still trying to collect evidence to convict Hillary I want them to cross all the T s and dot all the I s because she s slippery and we need to not allow this criminal to be President ,conservative

Ok isn t a bit unfair to say that no one was motivated to vote for Trump because of his race baiting speeches and policies yet go right back and say everyone protesting against Trump is just a violent looter Taking the worst examples of a group and then extrapolating them to represent the entire group is a reprehensible thing to do Also while this picture is trying to imply that this is from the anti Trump protests it s not This picture is from the Ferguson protests in 2014 http avax news pictures 114683 Those were much more racially motivated and directed towards police rather than anything political Unfortunately they did escalate to the point of attacking police But again to imply that the protesters have no argument because some of them got violent is just looking for an excuse to dismiss them without having to even acknowledge the points they have let alone rebut against them ,conservative
That s not even a Hillary protest you dingleberry ,conservative
This has nothing to do with this subreddit ,conservative
See what I find sort of weird is how we re after saying how we are tired of being called racist and homophobic and that s why trump won everyone just starts making blanketed and generalized statements against liberals and how their violent crybabies You guys are literally doing exactly what you guys said were against ,conservative

I feel like we are in such a tough position here On one hand we are being attacked and should be able to fight back On the other hand the battle is over and we won this continued fighting is only hurting this country I m not 100 certain but I think we should just ignore these thugs and move on Their tantrums are most likely an attempt to get a reaction out of us and perpetuate the conflict and divisions that they feed off of If we just ignore them we nullify their goals You take away people s power when you ignore them ,conservative

I only saw stories that said she got more popular votes than any white male in presidential election history which turns out to be true Though it would make more sense to go by of the population than actual head count given the growth in this country over time ,conservative

This whole thing about Fake News turned out exactly how I expected It s just turned into yet another thing that happens on both sides but each side says only the other side does I have seen article after article making wild accusations of Hillary based on very little fact and yet this is fake news Calling out fake news only works if you re willing to call it out on your side as well And while I ve seen some of that it doesn t happen nearly enough as it should ,conservative
she still got the popular vote though ,conservative
Maybe they meant Deceased votes ,conservative
She won the popular vote by more than any other losing president That s candidates that won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote like George W Bush As far as I can tell the only person who is pretending that anything like a landslide happened is trump who also claims that he won the popular vote if discount illegals voting in California which makes him the only president in history to win the vote and level accusations of voter fraud by percentage points but likely gross total as well ,conservative
So reddit is going to shadowban CNN next right ,conservative
I call bullshit Intentional negligence is not a mistake It is not an error Nevermind that even if it was true is meaningless Larger populations mean more voters Both Clinton and Trump had low numbers when you go by percentage of voters ,conservative
She also got less votes than trump after you discard illegal votes ,conservative
The strength with promoting these tactics I ve referred to this fake news phenomena multiple times as a combative information campaign in that they combat promoting of information with promoting their own campaign or in this case their narrative as many like to call it is that when we use their the words that they ve promoted it helps their cause If we couple this fake news campaign with the Streisand effect which is their intent we still promote their goals Abandon their dogma find your own and express your distaste with your own words One of the cornerstones of neural linguistic programming is being able to pressure your client as we ll call them here to think a certain thing when they hear a certain phrase see a certain symbol or feel a certain emotion In this case when we hear fake news we think in dichotomies Dichotomies are dangerous when delivered by someone with intent to persuade someone in that they can themselves define right from wrong tell you that something you re doing f,conservative

I just gotta say how enjoyable it is to read articles like this detailing exactly how incompetent the Clinton team was and how her hubris permeated the entire leadership of her campaign I could read stuff like this all day It s soul soothing to know that these people killed the prospect of an HRC presidency from the inside and that her ultimate legacy will be one of embarrassing defeat largely at the hands of the people she chose to surround herself with who were cut from the same flawed cloth that she was ,conservative

She isn t lying under oath here because she isn t answering the question He asked if classified information was exchanged on the server and she said none of it was marked classified None of it was marked classified because whenever she couldn t send a document because it was classified she took the classified heading off so it wouldn t be recognized as classified ,conservative

While technically it is possible for faithless electors to place their vote for Clinton in December there s zero chance it s gonna happen at least in quantities large enough to affect the outcome It s a 74 vote difference so at least 38 of them would have to switch from Trump to Clinton to give her the win So unless Trump goes right off the deep end and takes Pence with him and the polls reflect that the public would support the move it s simply not gonna happen ,conservative

The donors that drop out are just as bad as the corrupt clintons It just means they will find a new outlet for their bribery schemes Clinton Foundation will likely move money to some other entities as well so hey can give the bribe money back It will be interesting to see which large doners drop and which large transfers the foundation will make ,conservative
I will go out on a limb and make a prediction with the Clintons having lost most of their political influence the Clinton Foundation will find itself with drastic reductions in donations Saudi Arabia should still support women s rights AIDS care disaster relief etc if they were donating to CF for these reasons as some have stated no matter who won the WH I will bet their CF donations dry up though CF was a sham to allow foreign donors to buy influence from the expected next POTUS Hillary Clinton Clinton having lost will cause CF donors to stream away Also will former CF donors ask for their monies back as their avenue of influence never materialized ,conservative

I m not surprised that no one really recognizes or remembers that when the Clintons went to Hollywood in the early 90 s after Bill became President that they were going to get many of the industry s people in their pockets Then again I am in my 50 s and saw this stuff unfold at the time and even then in my 20 s was unimpressed by the way that the Hollywood crowd schmoozed the politicians and the politicians fawned and weened over the celebrities When media let themselves be awed by politics and politicians and cozy up to them you bet your ass that propaganda will be the net result This shit s been going on a long long time and part of why I do not have a connected TV in my home anymore ,conservative

If you read the email it shows what must be a producer emailing podesta for feedback and encouraging him to come on the show It s not exactly taking direct orders but it s certainly disgusting power worship I m not surprised either Colbert has been a government mouthpiece since Bush won his second election Sad because he really can be hilarious Conan for President ,conservative

I also heard Colbert took direct orders from many of his other guests that wanted clips and promotional advertising for being guests on his show How odd It s like people that go on his show want something they re working on to be advertised and create or send tapes to the show ahead of time so they can show it when they come on and talk about it ,conservative

Ah this is on the border Definitely it shows Minassian CGI claiming he exercised some level of influence on The Colbert Report But the characteristics of the influence are unclear it s not a smoking gun What s needed is an email between the producer or another show official and Minassian demonstrating a clear relationship It d have to be something where Minassian tells the show to air certain episodes favorable to CGI and the show responding along the lines of Yes master That s taking an order More likely is that the relationship is informal wherein the producers are discussing show ideas with Minassian What d be helpful is seeing how the show interacts with non CGI representatives and compare and contrast the different interactions If the relationship CGI diverges appreciably from how the show handles other relationships then there d be a stronger case for the claim that the show is taking orders ,conservative

Bigotry has nothing to do with judging other people for their opinions A person is a bigot if they are intolerant towards another person based on an immutable feature e g race sex sexual orientation edit I phrased this somewhat hamfistedly and overbroadly of course it is possible to be bigoted against someone based on their opinions e g religion but being intolerant of someone s opinion doesn t automatically make you a bigot It depends what the opinion is And the clearest cut cases of bigotry do not involve opinions they involve immutable features which the definition in OP doesn t even mention Judging a person for their opinions and actions is normal and not necessarily bigoted What am I not supposed to judge a Nazi for his beliefs ,conservative

Well personally I m in favor of the economic argument For every person who doesn t want to write Mr and Mr Fictionalson on a wedding cake there s probably a lot of bakers who would love to take Mr and Mr Fictionalson s money In the era of digital press any person can write a yelp review calling Wholesome bakery a group of bigots and cause them to be instantly protested and prank called and swatted not to say that swatting is remotely legal Online reputation can make or break a business when people are quick to jump to outrage over the slightest trigger Companies like Walmart also make wedding cakes and they have no religious affiliation and they hold a lot of power to tell protesters angry about the gay wedding cake to kindly shut up or they shut down the store and take the jobs with them If you want to take a stand on something these days you gotta be willing to face the crowds and the media when you do it or otherwise you ll get shot down ,conservative

Why The free market accounts for outside forces for journalism for boycotts These things would resolve without taking rights away but it seems we re not patient enough for it But in the case you re talking about I could see that at the time it was possibly a temporary necessity But that argument you make would mean that the government can force any thing like that on us There is no business in the US that isn t advantaged by the us government in someway So where is the line that distinguishes when the government can force such a thing on a business and when they leave you alone to your beliefs I would argue that those diner and such would have had to come around to market pressure pressure from the media etc It would have resolved itself if journalist covered properly and people were bold enough to see a demand in the area and bring business there So I think that case is irrelevant except in the instance that expediency of the natural systems is paramount I m not saying that that s the,conservative

Should I be tolerant to Nazis for their beliefs too No I will call them what they are and I will mock and belittle their ideology That s not bigotry Sometimes it is appropriate to be intolerant of someone s beliefs That s because people can change their beliefs it is a choice immutable features aren t You can judge people for their choices in fact that s the only thing you can judge them for ,conservative

Republican here I have personally downvoted a bunch of republican posts because they are taking facts out of context making unjustified claims pretending that liberals are the enemy and or that liberals are the cause of our problems I personally hope that this subreddit will be above the blatant bias that r politics clearly has and we will not just circlejerk that republicans are always right about everything Personally I like that moderate liberals come to this subreddit because that means they are looking for other possible solutions to our common problem and they are willing to see how we think about things That is a good thing Other than the downvote brigade that downvotes pretty much everything almost all of the liberals and democrats that I have seen comment here looking for a discussion has been clear headed and simply looking for a different viewpoint for an issue ,conservative

Personally I prefer to post in r conservative also you might want to look into some private subs I find the conversation there to be phenomenal Also it helps to just judge the quality of the post with out the upvote downvote ratio It does hinder seeing well thought out conservative comments at the top but it also makes me work through a comment to see if I just blindly agree If I agree I upvote if I think they are trolling I report if I disagree but they are voicing their opinion in a calm manner that isnt derogatory I ll leave the post alone and reply back with my own views ,conservative

Liberal here Sorry for the ones who come in just to be a downvote brigade It s just a matter of not understanding not being willing to apply reddiquette to a subreddit they don t agree with I look at liberals who downvote things just because they disagree with it as about the same people who tweet conspiracy theories at President Obama trying to elicit a response The only thing harder for me than downvoting hilarious reposts is upvoting comments stories here but I know that for the good of Reddit I have to do both As long as this remains a forum for legitimate discussion and doesn t become a Republican circlejerk akin to r politics I ll still come in and upvote stories and comments that contribute to the discourse ,conservative

Mod chiming in here I m not going to make a comment regarding the veracity or logic of any of the stances people take on Net Neutrality I want to take a moment to point out something about how our sub works and why we do some of the things we do You ll notice this is one of our top posts in a while I want you to notice specifically that this is a popular opinion with the left yes the right is largely on board with it too but that s secondary to the point The massive popularity of this post indicates a strong leftist liberal regressive presence in our sub And I don t really begrudge them for coming and watching that s totally fine And even engaging respectfully is fine or it would be if that respect for our rules could be maintained Now a Republican could post this and we d all have a nice discussion about it it might get a little heated at times and some of our liberal leftist regressive friends might feel like chiming in because this is one of very few things many of us agree on thoug,conservative
I am a Conservative and I am a technology professional The Republicans are dead wrong on this issue Net Neutrality is an incredibly good thing and everyone should be fighting for it ,conservative
How about we fix Monopolies that certain internet providers on areas all across america so we don t need Net Neutrality Edit Uh sorry if my solution is to libertarian I m not a actual republican I am a libertarian I probably shouldn t apologize for this but I just wanted everyone to know if my solution isn t a republican one But uh thanks for the up votes and the criticism Edit 2 To be fair republicans tend to be for a free market and less regulations so it does make sense for many of you to agree with me ,conservative

I am also a Conservative and a technology professional and I love non neutral networks I use them all the time at home I use them all the time on airplanes I m not convinced net neutrality is the solution I would rather the government own the lines and rent them to ISPs to provide a service than require all ISPs treat all data equally That way you get more competition and can still innovate ,conservative
That s all well and good but an explanation would be better than just trust me I m from the internet ,conservative
Net Neutrality is an incredibly good thing and everyone should be fighting for it When has burdensome regulation ever made an industry more competitive The big players survive just fine it s the little guys new entrants and innovators that get hit with higher barriers Secondly isn t just a little premature to start heavily regulating something that has had no problems in the free market I mean in any market place parties are allowed to compete and consumers make choices Do we know what consumers do to ISP who throttle data No we don t I don t hate regulations per se but they should be a last resort after the market place cannot effectively respond Net neutrality seems both premature and heavy handed ,conservative
Even if you fix monopolies there is still a significant cost associated with starting up On top of that big name companies can just lower their costs to price out new competition and then raise them again when that competition goes under I ve seen that exact scenario happen before ,conservative
Why not both Fix the monopolies and put net neutrality in place to prevent companies from screwing people over before that happens ,conservative
removed ,conservative
Our party is for allowing competition and not having nonelected officials decide what is effectively laws Most here on this sub won t agree with doing away with the concept of net neutrality but forcing it through non legislative actions isn t favored either ,conservative
the doomsday scenario wasn t happening before the rules went into effect Removing them doesn t mean the doomsday happens tomorrow the FCC claimed authority almost out of thin air based on laws from before the internet existed the FCC rules have so many holes they re toothless If we want neutrality rules they should come from Congress not from small panel of presidential appointees that gets to practically write its own laws If companies are treating people or businesses unfairly the FTC should be involved FCC rules are a duck tape solution for a situation actually caused by government interference in the free market at the state and local levels Market forces should be applied first before throwing up our hands and having the government treat cable tv and internet like the electric company Edit typo ,conservative
Innovation is the big one For instance most of the college age net neutrality supporters I saw shut up when I think it was Sprint offered free data for Pokemon Go as a promotion That s treating some data not like others I personally like being able to buy a cheap text messaging only plan when I am on airplane wi fi That s treating some data not like others I use a ton of qualify of service controls on my home network so people using P2P applications don t slow down my regular low bandwidth web browsing why shouldn t ISPs be able to do it at their level ,conservative
Net neutrality means so many things Most of it is good but I do have issue with some parts For example one of the big wireless companies I think AT T announced they ll let you stream video form the direct TV app without any impact on your data limits This being part of a joint deal that AT T and direct TV have Something like this is beneficial to consumers and can be a competition driver However something like this also violates net neutrality ,conservative

Context is everything guys Thatcher was swept into power following a long period of liberal domination that was propped up by power British trade unions She was elected primarily on a promise to take on organized labor in the UK due to the perception that they had disproportionate power in politics and had seriously mismanaged the economy as a result By contrast organized labor in the US never had the political power that they did in the UK so comparisons are somewhat spurious ,conservative

I don t doubt that a lot of Americans have mentioned breaking the miners unions when speaking negatively about thatcher but it s possible too that many of them are Brits who really couldn t give two shits about the American coal industry and are not being hypocritical here ,conservative
I think the bigger issue was that after proactively creating policy that killed jobs wholesale an act this sub s party seems to abhor in all cases she then promoted the perception that these jobless people were lazy moochers and deserved contempt Also the Falklands war and her dealings with Irish resistance were all the cause I need so say that she was a leader who had little value for human life ,conservative
no it s about union busting The miners had developed their own system of peer support and were basically socialist as a group and Thatcher wanted to remove the power from that group Privatizing the industry funneled the money up and away from the workers She helped facilitate one of the most extensive transfers of wealth in modern history You re right she was hated but at least get it right on why ,conservative

it s also possible that they are Americans that are pro coal and don t give two shits about global warming ,conservative

The point of this meme is to point out a double standard on the left In this case when someone on the right shuts down coal mines for union reasons it is a horrible act When someone on the left does the exact same thing but for environmental reasons it is a righteous act This is a double standard And for the record about half of US coal miners are unionized too Shutting down coal mines unquestioningly hurts well paying blue collar union jobs ,conservative

Hang on she didn t remove free milk for preschoolers people were still entitled to formula She didn t get rid of means tested school meals either So children from poor backgrounds still got a free hot meal every school day What she did is she stopped children between the ages of 7 and 11 receiving a drink of milk in the morning or afternoon break a throw back to post WW2 rationing Younger school children still got theirs All this in a nation known for its capacity and propensity to drink milky tea Not a single kid in the UK got bandy legs because Thatcher stopped their milk ration when she was Educational secretary It wasn t refrigerated So warm milk unless it was winter and not the sort nanna likes to make with nutmeg either ,conservative

I ve had very good results with discussions when we have gotten everyone involved to agree on certain ground rules The few rules of no negative labeling of people essentially a no name calling rule but a little more broad or strict and not allowing people to attribute negative intentions or motivations to people have done wonders in my experience So for example saying Jeff sessions is racist or Jeff sessions wants to disenfranchise black voters would be disallowed under these rules but it would be allowed to give a specific quote and say Jeff sessions said X and I think that is racist or I think Jeff Sessions policy to do X disenfranchises black voters These sorts of rules force people to be concrete about criticisms Interestingly the letter Elizabeth Warren read in the senate violated these rules by calling him a disgrace I doubt she would have gotten shut down had she followed these sorts of rules This is one reason why I think liberals could be more effective in their critiques of T,conservative

Detroit in this article is used as a metonym A metonym is a figure of speech used in rhetoric in which a thing or concept is not called by its own name but by the name of something intimately associated with that thing or concept For example when someone says The Jews control Hollywood that person is likely using Hollywood to refer to the U S film industry and is not stating that the Jews control a district of Los Angeles Likewise Romney is using Detroit to refer to the U S auto industry and not the city of Detroit ,conservative

None of the mainstream Republicans think this I m sure The talking heads Limbaugh Levin Beck Hannity et al were all against Romney until he was nominated And then they were all in love with him You ll never win with a mindless team mentality GOP didn t put their best man forward this election and it hurt them severely What s it matter if you nominate a guy who your base is comfortable with You need to focus on getting the support of independents and libertarian leaning people those whose vote you don t automatically have True conservative Americans have had it with these lukewarm big government imperialistic so called conservatives I have not yet voted for a Republican or Democratic president I WOULD have voted Republican for Ron Paul The GOP would have gained my vote a vote they didn t have automatically But they didn t nominate him so they didn t have my vote GOP had nothing to lose by nominating Ron Paul but they had a lot of votes to gain Paul would have beaten Obama and soundly I ,conservative
I m still convinced that it would be better to move the republican party in Ron Paul s direction rather than leave it altogether This has to be done in steps and it won t happen over night I voted for Bob Barr because I thought McCain was less economic libertarian than Bush but I voted for Romney because I felt like he was more of an economic libertarian than McCain I know it s awkward to even use that terminology to describe those candidates but we have to try to move the party in our direction rather than abandon it ,conservative
agreed and well said ,conservative
I wrote in Ron Paul I was surprised that Mitt lost though As much fraud as the GOP used to get him the nomination I was expecting them to still have some tricks up their sleeve for the general election ,conservative
Yup I voted Obama today but I have been reading R P s stuff since I was 17 I m registered republican for the last 2 cycles so I can cast my vote for R P in the primaries I live in a closed primary state ,conservative
Yup supported Ron Paul and have seen this coming since Romney was nominated Republicans lost my vote when they wouldn t entertain the idea s of liberty ,conservative

I am extremely liberal and would have voted for Gore anyway BUT I totally agree that John McCain in 2000 even 2004 would have been so much better than Bush The key word you used was restraint I think the experience of a war veteran would have served us well at that time He probably wouldn t have let the neocons form policy Now 2008 John McCain not so much By that time he was so desperate for the presidency that he pandered too much to the far right he sacrificed integrity for the nomination I was disappointed Not that all politicians don t do this to some extent but his shift was very extreme ,conservative

Our soldiers deserve respect whatever your opinion on war is They go through serious shit If you want to be angry at someone for it be angry at the Politicians for sending them to war On another note What do you think would happen if we didn t have our Military ,conservative
I m also a liberal but I ve always thought McCain would make a good president I certainly wouldn t have been sick to my stomach as I was when W was elected Palin was terrifying and I think you can see in that debacle how McCain s personal sense of honor and commitment to individuals won out over his sense of what was good for the country Unfortunately it seems like by the time they found out how toxic she was they had a choice between bulling forward and throwing the election ,conservative
McCain has lost his mind ,conservative
Well there d certainly be a lot more people out of work ,conservative
Liberal public health professional here I m in favor of this idea Nobody should be buying Doritos with food stamps I m also in favor of food stamp value being doubled for fruits and vegetables ,conservative
Public health guy here I am interested in seeing how this would work out I m skeptical but optimistic I wonder if incentive programs for healthy food would be more effective than outright bans on bad food They may just create a secondary market for junk food swapping Straw purchases for soda if you will ,conservative
So the argument is that since the government is paying for it they should have the right to dictate what that money gets spent on Fair enough but how is that any different than the multitude of religious exemption arguments regarding the hoopla over insurance policies I can t see a logical argument for one that doesn t work on the other ,conservative
Awesome finally someone actually does something to try and reform a non optimal program rather than just making it hard for people to get it or just cutting the funding all together ,conservative
Hopefully this works out well Nothing miffs me more than seeing a mom using foodstamps to buy oreos for her already overweight child ,conservative

And this isn t done all over the country why ,conservative
I have a much better idea why don t we stop subsidizing sugar ,conservative
As someone who uses food stamps and am a republican some of you might find that weird but I agree I want to be encouraged to buy good food I think the idea of the value being double for fruits and vegetables is a great idea as well I worked as a cashier for a while and I got really upset at people buying crap with their food stamps They got cell phones and manicures but they are buying crap to feed their kids Apparently in some places you can use food stamps to buy things like McDonald That needs to stop The point of the program is to provide those who are struggling with a means of getting nutritious food so they don t starve to death Not to get fries and a big mac ,conservative
I thought most states had done this in the mid 90 s No pre coooked foods and generically only if it is on the list WIC I believe Is texas just behind the curve here odd or am I missing something ,conservative
If you are on food stamps you should not have the luxury of choice Let me elaborate If you are living off the backs of others you should not be afforded the luxury of buying junk food or name brands while the people who provided your free food stamps buy off brand and scrimp to keep the cupboards full Rice rations Done ,conservative

I live in Ohio About 6 years ago they did this No more Rockstars and redbull on your food stamps It was almost worth sitting at one of the booths along the wall at the corner store near my house Listening to people scream about YOU CANT TAKE MY ROCKSTARS AWAY FROM ME I NEED THAT TO DEAL WITH MY BUSY LIFE But seriously food stamps need to work much more like WIC than anything with calories stamps Its to keep you from starving not so you can turn into a fat cow If you re going to eat on my dime it should be healthy and cheap ,conservative
If Republicans want to force a drug test on everyone reliant upon food stamps surely they would have no problem forcing them to use said stamps on food that is healthy ,conservative

In theory this will help diminish obesity The lower class are the most obese ironically It s because they buy mostly junk food with food stamps And yes it is common to see shopping carts full of junk food payed for with food stamps My father owns a business that involves working with grocery stores and he sees it all the time ,conservative
Please Please Please do this Not for health reasons but because they are luxury items and not necessary Include fruits veggies meats breads baby items spices baking ingredients and some foods that are easier to prepare canned foods casaroles etc Don t make it hard to eat but don t give them food that the rest of us can t afford ,conservative
Lemme you a story I was lying in a hospital with a herniated disk making small talk with a nurse about all sorts of things He told me that he did a lot of work in his previous job teaching people how to buy groceries plan meals cook budget etc He said he had one guy take all of his food stamps and bought cases of red bull that were on sale The guy thought he was doing a GOOD thing with his stamps that he was trading up The guy didn t have the mental capacity to understand that he probably wasn t going to like surviving on red bull He had to be taught to plan his meals rather than just lunging for whatever he could whenever he could We like to immediately politicize these issues because it makes it easier to find answers in our box of opinions ,conservative
Democrat here I am in favor of this though to be honest I am not sure how much good it will do Junk food is far cheaper than healthy alternatives and the very poor might opt to buy them anyway This might be offset by increasing the value for fresh food ,conservative

He was a stand up guy and president to be proud of ,conservative
edit My B just some auto correct nothing to see here ,conservative
Changes in the primary system and the decline of party politics caused the polarisation of American politics The Republican candidates are merely bowing to the whims of their much louder after primary reforms base which is to be uncompromising and speaking to the lowest common denominator It s sad because HW is a president to be proud of As was Reagan if a little socially conservative for me ,conservative
I don t think there s a decline in GOP candidates We had a very diverse field when it came to ideas I feel that what is so attractive about the Republican Party is that it s a way bigger tent than the democrat party There are conservatives progressives moderates libertarians and it seems we are welcoming populists now which is interesting Just because Donald won doesn t mean the GOP lacks ideas Actually it shows another step in us trying something different regardless of whether you think it s good or bad ,conservative

Uh I think if you claim to hold an opinion and then claim to hold the opposite opinion then you are a flipflopper And if you do it to appease someone else then you are a sellout However I thought Romney s speech was sincere and a credit to the man I wish he d been that way the whole time It was the only time I heard him say something admirable ,conservative
If the GOP let Romney stick to economics then he would have won But no Romney also had to represent the religious fanatics and appease unpopular conservative values I would have voted for him but Republicans threatened my ability to marry the man I love ,conservative
The Republican party needs to deal with a divided base I m still trying to wrap my head around how you can cater to social conservative ideas which require big government to actually enforce and still keep the small government fiscal conservatives happy Democrats on the other hand mostly agree but differ on the extent of government s role First problem is social issues The further the Republicans go into social conservative territory the more Libertarian I vote The part of the party that hold ups up Akin and Santorum scare me and the harder they push them the further women and fiscal conservatives are going to to run The second problem is the implosion of the Tea Party I don t think either party are really willing to take the lumps it s going to require to fix the economy Fixing the economy on a fundamental level is going to be painful It s going to be political suicide to do it I think we saw that most politicians just aren t going to do it when Tea Party people started supporting big,conservative

Mark my word if and when these preachers get control of the Republican party and they re sure trying to do so it s going to be a terrible damn problem Frankly these people frighten me Politics and governing demand compromise But these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God so they can t and won t compromise I know I ve tried to deal with them Barry Goldwater ,conservative
My problem with Romney is that he wasn t honest He did flip flop to pander to voters when he may have held different beliefs internally You can t trust people like that that s sell out behavior It seems to me the Republican party has turned into a socially conservative more fiscally liberal group whereas the Democrats have turned into a socially liberal and a more fiscally conservative group I don t expect Democrats nor Republicans would have drastically different spending habits is what I am saying Historically this was not the case but that s the way I see it is now The Libertarian party is closer to traditional Republican values in my opinion ,conservative
Republicans would have won if they had picked up even half of the Ron Paul Gary Johnson crowd Maybe they should stop ridiculing and ostracizing people who advocate for individual rights and economic liberty Or you could just run a Mormon again I m sure that will work out well ,conservative
I ve seen the GOP do this since George H W Bush That was a guy who was probably fairly moderate but was pushed farther right by extremist elements in the party Had he been allowed to pursue his own agenda he might have won a second term Sadly the evangelical strategy they subsequently pursued blinded them to this possibility for other candidates such as Romney ,conservative

I m a 29 year old gainfully employed white male liberal democrat from New York state I voted for Obama 4 years ago and did so again yesterday I felt Obama did an okay job in his first term and I was ready to consider the Republican candidate this time around But Romney was just the worst possible choice I could have ever imagined the GOP could have won this election had they not created a monster out a decent enough guy From my point of view I saw a fake plastic political caricature that embodies the glad handing pandering win at all costs politician that s resoundingly mocked by everyone Maybe in 2016 the GOP will roll out a candidate who can at least appear less like a marionette s puppet ,conservative

No you cannot absolve Romney so easily 1 Romney is a control freak and he ran his campaign the way he wanted to run his campaign 2 Romney demonstrated over and over he would be terrible on foreign policy He insulted the British the Polish the Russians the Chinese He wants to expand a bloated military and increase the bleed 3 Romney can t connect to women for whatever reason His views are shaped by the religion that he is devoted to and woman are second class citizens in Mormonism The can t even make it to heaven without marrying someone that calls them up to the Celestial Heaven Glorification anything short is damnation 4 Romney couldn t connect to blacks and other minorities He couldn t demonstrate in his personal life any connection to any minority His church believes blacks are cursed as such for a lack of support for God in their lives as spirits before they were born Heck until 1978 they couldn t even be glorified because they couldn t be married in the temple or if male be a memb,conservative
That s not the party s decision though That s something the Romney campaign decided to do Partly because he had very weak conservative credentials GOP should have gone with Ron Paul ,conservative
As a young voter 21 years old I think Mitt Romney s campaign made ONE reach out to young voters during the town hall debates And he didn t really even answer the question fully he just said the economy had to be better EDIT If he had explained how bosses aren t going to hire much under Obama s business regulations it would really have helped him that s what convinced me Obama was constantly visiting universities addressing adds to us meeting us through social media directed at us I sincerely look for Mitt s addresses to us his whole campaign I didn t really find any I assumed this was because he thought there was no way he convince anyone of us but I was waiting for it It felt like he had given up on us I voted for Mitt after a long heart to heart with my Dad that helped me rethink things about the economy and businesses that would be looking to hire me when I graduate Not once did I do it because Mitt The Republicans had reached out to us Obama was a young persons idol on social issue,conservative
Your party needs to drop the religious right or young voters will never vote for them And pretty soon those young voters are going to be the ones running the show Without serious changes restructuring and modernization your party is going to fade from relevance in this country I hope to one day be able to choose from two or more level headed candidates and not a moderate and extremists ,conservative

Using religion to support any argument is a very stupid move The GOP needs to shut the fuck up about rape and homosexuality This election needed to focus on the deficit that s why we had a business man as a candidate Instead we had some of our own making some of the stupidest comments imaginable about rape being God s will and so forth They turned this into a social issue so the more important issues got placed on the back burner This country is becoming more and more atheist and it s NOT the government s role to fix that Instead we need to approach our country s issues from a responsibility angle and focus on forcing Americans to be accountable for their actions Disclaimer I am a Lutheran and a Republican I endorsed Mitt Romney and I honestly feel that if he didn t have the insane ramblings of a select few Michele Bachmann representing the Republican Party I think we would have had a better chance ,conservative
I m in my mid 30 s upper middle class have a wife and kids and was brought up a Republican and still call myself a Republican but the current Republican party has lost me I voted for Obama in 2012 the first time I ve voted for a Democratic presidential candidate The Republican party has let its base lead them too far to the right Unless they find a leader that can steer the party so that it appeals at least to the moderates within the party the party is going to get further and further behind Personally I wish the Republican party would de emphasize social issues tax the extremely wealthy support the Buffett Rule or similar and embrace a more liberal immigration policy ,conservative

I may not support any of the major parties Green Party here but I completely agree This is also why McCain lost to Obama 4 years ago Do any of you remember the McCain before the election the guy that came onto the very liberal Daily Show with Jon Stewart more often than any other political figure and thrived hell even Jon liked him and a lot of the liberal viewers did too To me he was one of the most likable republicans out there But then the election started and it was like he got brainwashed and the man I knew from before who I may have actually supported was gone If the GOP had let Governor Mitt Romney run for President the guy that helped usher in healthcare reform before Obamacare in his state instead of While Collar Millionaire Mitt Romney then this race would have been a lot closer if not a victory for the GOP They need to stop trying to win via lies and ignorance and start treating people like they are not idiots The actual ignorant people are going to vote for them regardless ,conservative

That s an odd argument to make about federally chartered federally backed government sponsored enterprises The problem was and is that it essentially privatized gains but socialized losses creating a moral hazard They were gambling with the house s money And then there s the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 which put affirmative obligations on Fannie and Freddy to promote affordable housing Add to this the Clinton Administration s use of the Community Reinvestment Act and you have organizations with de facto obligation to make cheap loans to people who should not have qualified under good lending standards It was an utterly predictable and predicted debacle ,conservative

No it didn t There are many causes to the collapse of the housing market and the recent financial turmoil but the contribution of the CRA appears marginal While banks did engage in subprime lending in their assessment areas they did so at a lower rate than the market in general and accounted for only a small fraction of subprime loans to lower income borrowers and lowerincome neighborhoods The data suggest that far from being forced into risky corners of the market the institutions under the scrutiny of the CRA were crowded out by unregulated lenders http www jchs harvard edu research publications subprime lending and community reinvestment act Assuming ABBS s analysis is correct the paper shows pretty clearly that the CRA did not play a significant role in fomenting the housing bubble While the CRA may have lead to more risky lending what is most striking about the paper s findings are how small in magnitude the CRA s effects are While ABBS find statistically significant impacts the m,conservative

There s nothing wrong with high risk loans so long as they aren t mis represented The problem wasn t that high risk loans existed it s that try we re bundled into funds and the funds were sold as low risk Plus privatizing profit and assuming the risk is one function of the government The government should not be competing with businesses but can assume business risk in order to better society Encouraging home ownership is one example funding advanced research is another Patents and copyright are another form of government privatizing profits and reduce business risk although many would argue they actually harm society instead of helping it ,conservative

Wrong on both counts Leaving aside the bundling issue they were not charged an appropriate interest rate to offset the risk As to the second I completely disagree except for what are called public goods And Intellectual property has nothing at all to do with privatizing profit and socializing loss for example I m a patent attorney Privatizing gain and socializing loss creates some very very bad incentives None of the things you mentioned except the housing market issue fall into that category It means basically that you create a no risk situation for someone which encourages irrational risks that they would not have taken if they knew they were not backstopped by government ,conservative

OBAMA SPECIAL You could just as well call it the Bush Special US Public Debt Ceiling http en wikipedia org wiki File US_Public_Debt_Ceiling_1981 2010 png ,conservative
Bush raised it from 6 to 11 5 in 8 years a 5 5T increase so 0 6875T year Obama raised it from 11 5 to 16 7 in 5 years a 5 2T increase so 1 04T year So far it seems more appropriate to call it the Obama Special Of course Obama could pull a 180 and work very hard to lower the deficit in his last 3 years Based on the historical data presented above and the fact that we haven t seen the majority of spending that will be required for things like ACA it seems unlikely For now the Obama special seems more appropriate ,conservative

The rates are different but the concept is the same I m not sure Bush had a philosophically different approach to debt ,conservative

Don t confuse him with the facts ,conservative
More specifically here are the numbers all adjusted for inflation Regan was given a budget deficit of 203 billion in Carters 1981 budget He immediately increased it 50 in the 1982 budget to 310 billion This was followed by another 50 increase to 487 billion in 1983 When he left office he handed GBush a deficit of 287 billion a 40 increase from where he started GBush took that 287 billion he was handed in 1989 and in 1990 delivered a deficit of 390 billion Again the following year it rose to 461 billion When he was defeated by Clinton he handed him a deficit of 412 billion A smaller percent rise than Reagan handed him but a significant increase from 287 billion Overall from Democrat to Democrat the deficient rose from 203 billion to 412 billion an increase of over 100 Clinton went from an initial 412 billion he was given and despite having D s in control on both sides of the isle took that down to 251 in two years Republicans came in to help and he managed to take that 251 deficit to a ,conservative

Politics not withstanding I can t let bad math sit without responding The important number isn t the total amount the debt goes up or down in a year it s the rate the debt goes up or down If the debt started at 6 trillion and went to 11 5 trillion over 8 years then that s an 8 47 increase per year compounding annually Going from 11 5 trillion to 16 7 trillion is an annual compounded rate of 7 75 This is not a defense of Obama though it s certainly a criticism of Bush Both of these rates are disastrous as even the most die hard tax and spend Democrat can t fail to acknowledge that a national debt growing faster than the GDP is unsustainable and rates this much higher are a recipe for disaster ,conservative

It would have been better to socialize the entire system rather than what they did with Obamacare Probably would have cost less too I don t have the figures but I m guessing Obamacare has cost us more than Canada or the UK pays for their socialist health care The problem with Obamacare is that it does nothing good everything bad and costs a shitton of shittons of money ,conservative
In countries with a single payer healthcare system healthcare is overused because citizens believe the government is paying for it which puts a strain on the system and increases federal expenditures Additionally medical research will be hindered more accurately research dollars will go the wrong areas In a single payer system the government sets the prices for health services and will inevitably overpay for some profits are an indicator of where research dollars should be spent which in this case may not be the correct area ,conservative
If the government is in charge of paying for healthcare and you have cancer the government gets to decide what treatments you are going to get Suppose treatment A is cheaper than new more successful but very expensive treatment B Guess which treatment you are getting Treatment A Suppose drug company A comes up with a new drug They can lobby congress and donate money to the candidate that will make their new drug the only legal treatment that the government will pay for ,conservative

it does nothing good everything bad Please help me understand how some aspects of the law are bad I feel that when I hear people talk about how the entire thing is a trainwreck and needs to be repealed and started over they only look at a few pieces of the law The stuff about pre existing conditions I have many friends who can finally get health insurance because of the law I think this is a very good thing Staying on parent s insurance until 25 In the past it was once you were through with school you were kicked off job or no job Now there is a little bit of a grace period where someone can job search and still keep insurance This is the reason I currently have health care I graduated in July and found a job with benefits starting in a few weeks Once the marketplace gets up and running correctly won t that help people shop for their best available plans They can compare plans side by side as is my understanding Why would this be a bad thing Don t get me wrong I understand there are se,conservative
So instead we ll settle for the most expensive healthcare that is the main cause of bankruptcies even to people who have insurance and not have the best life expectancy Because that makes sense ,conservative
Well the healthcare system here in the UK isn t really overused I mean there are campaigns to make sure people actually go to the doctors if they think something is wrong rather than just hoping it will go away In our system the NHS the front end healthcare provider buys its drugs and the like from private companies which do the research while the NHS does its own research as well it tends to be into more expensive things ,conservative
I m not really sure how drugs are chosen in the NHS UK but I do know that it is a separate body to the Ministry of Health I don t think that the MoH gets very much influence in the day to day running of the NHS but that it is down to the bosses of that of course they can be lobbied as well but its not quite like congress Those arguments are both valid though the rules would have to be very clear in how to ensure that doesn t happen Also seeing as I am likely not going to get a response off anyone else here now why is a single payer scheme regarded as sinister Or was that just elcoogarino s opinion ,conservative
Helpfully worded I was just curious I am British and we have a pretty good universal healthcare system and wanted to know the reasons why you don t want one as I haven t heard the arguments against it ,conservative
In that case would you rather get rid of Medicare and the VA ,conservative
Good question There s no doubt that healthcare costs were out of control even before Obamacare My issue with it has always been that it did nothing to fix rising costs and just made the problem worse But would a socialist system be an improvement I would say no because for some reason our government is incredibly incompetent and expensive as it is But that would be an interesting debate to have I think an ideal solution or at least a step in the right direction would have been capping malpractice liability for doctors and deregulating medicine Every doctor has to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for malpractice insurance because if they re ever sued the sky s the limit And that cost is of course passed along to the patient And the FDA Food and Drug Administration makes sure that medicine costs 10 times as much here compared to say Canada or Mexico ,conservative

You complaining that our system is expensive so government needs to get involved is what makes no sense Our system is expensive because government is so involved This is a common argument amongst the uninformed Why is healthcare so expensive You never ask that question Government dollars is why Every sector the government involves itself in is overpriced Look at college tuition and housing Both markets have extensive government involvement and used to be affordable before government got involved If you flood a market with free money prices will inflate to match you will not buy more services objects with the money because the prices will simply be higher In order to make the policy work price controls have to be introduced Over and over again every leftist attempts this same cycle of destruction subsidies price controls shortages inflation and Obama will be no exception ,conservative

Basically its just the idea that the free market will produce cheaper prices better treatments and more care When you go to single payer the government decides the price and the treatment you can get For example Contact lenses in the U S used to be very expensive when they first came out let s pretend 100 The government insurance for the poor medicaid does not cover lenses Thus ophthalmologists optometrist and even wal mart began competing to sell contact lenses Innovation kicked in and now contact lenses are dirt cheap 20 Had we been on a single payer system the government would have decided the price of lenses when they came out 100 Now everyone in the country can pay 100 for contact lenses because the government pays for it So the price stays the same Now imagine this principle for something more serious like a heart stent Its just a metal mesh that keeps your arteries open It will extend your life 10 years It costs like thousands of dollars Now lets talk the other end of the spectr,conservative

Winnipeg resident here Not trying to make a particular point but our gun laws are even tighter than Chicago and our murder rate is half that of Houston and we re considered a dangerous city in Canadian terms Maybe the problem isn t just guns or no guns eh It s also a lot colder here than Chicago ,conservative
Logic ,conservative
Population density of Chicago 12 855 38 people per square mile Population density of Houston 3 071 73 people per square mile Why wasn t that on the chart Chicago is over four times 400 more densely populated than Houston Well would you look at that The number of homicides is approximately four times 400 higher in Chicago too So weird I firmly believe that gun ownership should be legal but I do NOT believe that murder rates are very closely tied to legality of firearms Any one of us can look inside ourselves and realize that if we wanted to kill someone we would not be deterred by the fact that we can t buy a handgun to do it ,conservative

I m not trying to get into a quarrel here but there are differences between the two cities geographically that might contribute a bit to these statistics Houston is a lot more spread out and there are several subdivisions outside of the metropolitan area that are considered Houston Doesn t it make sense that there would be less homicides in a less dense area That being said I am in support of gun rights But comparing Chicago to Houston is unfair ,conservative

There is a correlation between heat and murder rates Being hot causes people to lose their temper more easily And if I may generalize a little bit fewer people have air conditioning in the north because it s hot for less of the year In Texas mostly everyone has air conditioning all the time and are more used to the heat so that could really be a factor Also the population is much less dense in Houston and urban environments are also correlated with murder I personally don t think that murder rates are directly correlated with laws at all Murderers don t care about the law ,conservative

Winnipeg is also a less than third the size of Houston and a less than quarter the size of Chicago I realize that murder rates are per 10 000 population but smaller cities usually have lower rates than larger ones to begin with Chicago has a population density of 11 998 44 people per square mile http voices yahoo com largest us cities population size 2012 6453656 html cat 16 Houston s population density is 3 493 80 people per square mile Winnipeg s population density is 1 365 2 people per km 2 which translates to 3535 9 people per square mile about the same as Houston The racial demographic of Winnipeg is substantially different than either Houston or Chicago however with Visible Minorities accounting for only 15 of the population and 75 of those being Asian http winnipeg ca cao pdfs TheCommunityTrendsReportApril2012 pdf ,conservative
Could it be that maybe it s because Canada has a comprehensive health care program which includes MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATIONS Crazy gonna kill no matter where you are whether you have guns or not no matter the temp outside ,conservative

Banning guns is stupid anyway it will keep guns out of the hands of the citizens and the bad guys will have them anyway In fact there would probably be a number of side affects like a violent illegal gun trade Just look at what happened when the government banned alcohol and other substances ,conservative
Why does everyone automatically assume all liberals want to ban guns I live in Seattle a very liberal city and the only people I know who own guns are my most hardcore liberal friends Trust me there are many liberals who grip their guns just as tightly as many of the people in this thread but when we try to have a reasonable discussion on gun legislation that promotes gun safety it comes to an immediate halt when one side goes OMG WHY YOU WANT TAKE MY GUNS AWAY It is possible to do gun control without banning everyone s guns At the very least we could require people to complete a gun safety class before they can own a gun It may not prevent mass shootings but perhaps if the shooters mom had locked her guns and or ammunition like a responsible gun owner all those people wouldn t be dead ,conservative
I think another major point that needs to be made here and I am not hearing it is the fact that a majority of these shootings have been done by people who are not registered to own a firearm which means that they are gaining these weapons by illegal means This draws more attention to the old proverb locks only keep honest people out and translates to the fact that in a perfect society we would need no laws every law guides the honest and the dishonest will always either break the law or find a way around them ,conservative
Everyone needs to get these terms straight Assault Riffles Illegal since 1984 They are 15000 There are no crimes in the U S that use these fully automatic riffles Assault weapon legal They are not fully automatic They are typically black and are confused with fully automatics If you see a gun that looks like its from the military it is probably an assault weapon This includes the AR 15 and AK 47 For everyone that is saying Assault riffles need to be regulated you are talking about black rifles that look like the military version but do not have the same functionality as their military brothers Remember these are not fully automatic Edit CT already has an Assault weapon s ban He used a normal riffle ,conservative

There s no reason for anyone to have an assault rifle just like there s no reason for anyone to have sarin gas or a dirty bomb These are things designed for mass killing and there s just no reason to have one People have the right to have a gun and they should have one if they feel they need it for protection but you don t need an assault rifle you just don t Would it have stopped this No But it would have made it harder to kill so many ,conservative

He does have a point that only a maniac would intentionally kill with a chainsaw a vehicle or a gun and only an idiot would do so accidentally But can t gun advocates acknowledge the difference in scope Traffic accidents are unfortunately commonplace much moreso than gun accidents and so we license and register and test auto owners and drivers and their vehicles Intentional shootings are much more common than intentional vehicular homicide and it is much easier for psychopaths to kill and injure a huge number of people than it would be to do so with a vehicle Can we not do something then to limit the ability of a maniac to get hold of a weapon with such destructive power ,conservative

Whenever someone spouts off about banning guns or making guns laws even stricter I remind them of the laws against Marijuana and how successful they are with keeping weed out of the hands of whoever wants them All stricter gun laws or a complete ban on guns will do is make it harder for law abiding citizens to protect themselves because evil doers will get their hands on them regardless Now I m not saying we should be handing out guns like candy but banning firearms is definitely not the answer ,conservative
There was a study of us combat veterans and ptsd relating the personnel killing The study found that the proximity to the victim increased the frequency of PTSD Personel on Bombers generally had no ptsd even though their actions caused the largest amount of death However with ground troops snipers had the least PTSD vs Infantry soldiers and within Infantry infantrymen that killed with their guns at a distance had a much lower PTSD rate than those who wound up in hand to hand combat situations what the findings come down to is that it was much easier for those members of the military to kill from a distance than it was to do so at close proximity So mentally killing at 50 ft with a gun is much easier than say going up to some one toe to toe and jamming a kife into their throat which kinda makes sense i wish I knew where to find the study it was fascinating at the time If anyone knows where it is I d appreciate it ,conservative

The top comment is criticizing the article The article itself gets upvoted for any number of reasons including popcorn ,conservative

yup totally gun s fault ban guns s there was a time when high schoolers carried a couple in their trunk but also were taught safety with a smack on their head at a young age I shot my first bullet when I was 8 This helped me to understand how dangerous and necessary guns are and also kept me behaving responsibly around them and then there are these gangs that are allowed to exist merely because any law enforcer that d dare take action against them is slapped with racist label on their face by SJWs and liberals that doesn t have a clue about whats going on in reality ,conservative

Legalize all drugs You take the easy money away and move the Black market to the organized market that can settle disputes with the court system ,conservative
Legalize weed then put some money toward changing culture around these communities to promote traditional values like the traditional family Crime is byproduct of poverty and the best way to leave poverty is to marry someone There s a great video on the subject https www youtube com watch v KIpcxy9M1pw ,conservative
Broken window policing did a good job on it but that s not allowed any more per the race grievance industry Securing the borders and deporting the illegals would certainly help but almost no one in government at the Federal level wants to do that and many at the state and city levels are adamantly opposed Changing welfare to incentivize marriage and employment rather than the reverse would help too but the left will oppose that Ending leftist control of schools so that we could actually address the issues in inner city public school education would also help as would ending leftist control of the cities themselves I m pretty sure the American left won t go along with those measures either ,conservative

Lets be honest He s right In both that its hypocrisy and there is racism in Trumps movement Time will tell ,conservative
To be fair he s saying that it s just as hypocritical to think of all muslims as one group terrorists as it is to think of all trump supports as racist Exact quote Like there are guys in my neighborhood that I love that I respect that I think have incredible qualities who are not afraid of Mexicans and not afraid of Muslims and not afraid of blacks They re afraid of their insurance premiums he continued In the liberal community you hate this idea of creating people as a monolith Don t look as Muslims as a monolith They are the individuals and it would be ignorance But everybody who voted for Trump is a monolith is a racist That hypocrisy is also real in our country ,conservative
He s right though The End of Identity Liberalism NYT http www nytimes com 2016 11 20 opinion sunday the end of identity liberalism html The extent to which the Dems campaigned on identity politics to the exclusion of issues was astounding I guess that was the doing of Clinton s campaign manager Robby Mook ,conservative

A small amount of self reflection that is too little too late The ism shouting has worn out it s welcome ,conservative
Is the reason the word hypocrisy is in quotes because you agree that the right paints monolithic pictures of groups Or is it marked that way because it s not hypocrisy because only the left is guilty of this ,conservative

there is racism in Trumps movement It s probably true just like it s true that there is violent extremism in parts of Islam In both cases it s not fair to label the entire group by their worst members ,conservative
The extent to which the Dems campaigned on identity politics to the exclusion of issues was astounding Concur And HRC was known to be a wonk which makes it extra strange You may not have agreed with her positions but she reportedly knew her shit And then she goes and runs on the minority vote Here s something interesting about the minority vote you need a majority to win ,conservative

This video was from April 2014 long before the primaries were underway The story was about Cliven Bundy and Donald Sterling and Trump was only included because he defended Sterling He wasn t calling Trump supporters racists they didn t exist yet ,conservative
Back in April April of 2014 how are these Trump supporters before Trump starting his run He s calling a racist person racist and calling two KKK members racist this has no conflict with what he said in OP s post ,conservative

That makes sense On one hand Clinton was running as a continuation of Obama But to address the economic woes people still feel would insinuate that the Obama policies had failed or at least failed to live up to their lofty promise You can t have it both ways And ultimately people feeling Clinton wasn t focusing on their economic needs is one of the larger reasons she lost ,conservative
The idea that citizens should be free to say what they want and to publish what they want is what protects democracy The idea that there is a class of people who are not beholden to the people but are granted power over the Government is an extremely scary proposition The Constitution didn t establish the press as some fourth branch of government that is obligated to check the power of the other three The Constitution ensures its citizens can be free because that is the only way to have a free press ,conservative
If you aren t a fan of the biased domain let s look at the Chicago Tribune s take http www chicagotribune com news nationworld politics ct john mccain criticizes trump 20170219 story html I think of them as a little less left leaning than a lot of the mainstream outlets and they re covering this more or less similarly or if anything a little more harsh on Trump in their headline ,conservative

John McCain in 9 years was never this critical of Barack Obama including while he was running against him ,conservative
I agree Trump shouldnt be fighting with the press but the press undermined themselves Theyre constantly fighting for the media on behalf of the media etc when they should be fighting for the people The press has to make a choice they can either be the true 4th estate something they seemed uninterested in doing the last 8 12 years or they can just keep fighting Trump like this is some kind of dick measuring contest Guess what Trump is the president he is going to win the dick measuring contest every time The idea that the only problem here is Trump ignores why what he is doing has been so successful ,conservative
Where was McCain when Obama attacked the free press ,conservative
It will be interesting to see if the rumors about McCain being the source of a lot of leaks pan out ,conservative

Obama took actions against what he deemed fake news Trump just speaks out against it A real dictator starts by taking away guns something obama would have loved to do if he knew it wouldn t start a civil war ,conservative

The problem is the press is no longer free It s controlled by all the special interests and money The Wikileaks proved that many media outfits were taken orders from the DNC When you have CNN and others asking the DNC for questions to ask GOP candidates and the NYT running articles on HRC by her campaign for approval before publishing it that s a problem I am all for a free press that holds everyone accountable but it is very disturbing when they re working for one side That s exactly why Trump won the election ,conservative
There is nothing wrong with attacking the media for being hacks Just as there is nothing wrong with attack judges for being hacks These people aren t gods or special in anyway ,conservative
McCain is still sippin on Haterade from 2008 ,conservative
Considering that Free Press was unabashedly supporting the candidate who rigged elections to get nominated the irony of this intellectual midget trying to compare him to a dictator is revolting ,conservative
The press behaves irresponsibly and pushes narratives i think McCain attacks Trump to stay in the spotlight ,conservative
McCain is really relevant in the PC right pro amnesty and neocon circles of the Republican Party A real good direction for the GOP lol ,conservative
Thank God this man lost to Obama in 2008 He likes to betray his own ,conservative
The idea that there is a class of people who are not beholden to the people but are granted power over the Government is an extremely scary proposition Admittedly a disconcerting proposition but what class are you talking about If this is supposed to be a reference to the press it s a bad one The press doesn t have any power over government other than the ability to convince people to exercise their power over the government ,conservative

Only wing nuts have claimed Bush had anything to do with 9 11 and none of the seriousmedia ever did Similarly only wing nuts would claim Obama was lying about Benghazi ,conservative
Media has given him cover What I ve heard about this shit every day since it happened and I don t even watch Fox ,conservative
Reminder that the Bush government was warned one month in advance of a plot by Al Quada to commit major terrorist attacks in the US using airplanes Reminder that Bush used 9 11 as pretense to attack and invade Iraq a war that cost the US trillions of dollars and thousands of lifes ,conservative
Well I think most people left or right would say that Bush did a decent job handling 9 11 Most of the hate that Bush gets is for deploying too many troops to Iraq all the liberals bring up the WMDs I also think that someone has to be incredibly ignorant if they have not realized that the media is incredibly left winged other than FOX of course and that Obama is a god in their eyes ,conservative
Then Thousands of Americans die during attack in America Now 4 Americans die overseas As my memory recalls George Bush sent thousands MORE Americans to die overseas Obama has tried to get these hero s back home If Romney wins thousands more Americans will die when he starts another criminal war with Iran ,conservative
I think there s a significant difference between an attack in the United States and an attack in an unstable part of the world that has been self destructing for as long as I can remember If a soldier dies in Afghanistan the president doesn t stop everything because there s a chain of command and a process to handel different orders events ,conservative

Congrats Your my first Down vote ever ,conservative
courtesy of the Joe Pags show http www facebook com JoePagsShow ,conservative
He did lie Same with Biden They claimed that had no idea of the attack If he knew it was a terrorist attack why did he blame a movie an protesters They told us they were not told but they were informed by e mail they were watching the attack via video real time and they had a drone overhead watching the fall It took 7 hours for the attack to end in a tragic result If Obama and his staff didn t know it means he and his staff are incompetent ,conservative
I think people are more just angry at them using terrorism as an excuse to justify everything ,conservative
They did lie though There are now emails showing that they received the updates in real time and the emails specifically said that they were under attack by a specific terrorist group ,conservative
Only wing nuts have claimed Bush had anything to do with 9 11 But plenty of leftists have said that he was somehow negligent and allowed it to happen ,conservative
Check out CBS news You may find this leaked interview http www humanevents com 2012 10 25 cbs news releases video showing obama knew benghazi was a terrorist attack will prove your Benghazi theory is not quite true An interview just 1 day later showed he knew it was a straight out terrorist attack and not some out of hand rioting Coupled with the revelation that they had real time video of the attack from the embassy This lie was carried on for 2 weeks Why I can only speculate that such an attack wouldn t fit with the story that Obama is the Al Qaeda destroyer he portrays himself as being and it would cover up gross incompetence when extra security was asked for and denied That s only my wing nutted theory though ,conservative
During the Bush years it was a very popular conspiracy theory Many liberals I know subscribed to a variant of it ,conservative
Wat They lied blatantly for 2 weeks Not to mention the 3 years before it But thats besides the point ,conservative
Seriously Hell the media pushed the video story more than the WH ,conservative
Reminder that the Bush government was warned one month in advance of a plot by Al Quada to commit major terrorist attacks in the US using airplanes Reminder that no one expected the planes to be flown INTO buildings Expectation was that this might mean hijacking which is as old as time Reminder that we have greatly tightened security and Americans bitch about it constantly Reminder that first Al Qaeda attack on WTC was a bomb on the ground in the parking garage Reminder that Bush used 9 11 as pretense to attack and invade Iraq a war that cost the US trillions of dollars and thousands of lifes Reminder that we formed a coalition to go into Iraq alongside the USA due to Iraq s repeated refusals to comply with UN resolutions regarding WMD s Reminder of people who talked about Iraq s WMD s http www davidstuff com political wmdquotes htm We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country Al Gore Sept 23 2002 In the four years since the inspe,conservative
Imagine an intelligence briefing well in advance Libyan terrorists determined to attack embassy Obama ignores it makes no preparation Then later after the attack uses it to justify invading Syria If that s how it went Obama would deserve to be tossed out of office ,conservative

I don t think Bush gets hate for deploying too many troops to Iraq I think he gets hate for attacking them at all I am from Canada so it is not as much of an issue but the Iraq was is pretty much universally regarded as a disaster and is one of the major reasons the United States has lost standing in the world ,conservative
As someone on the left I don t think he did a decent job handling 9 11 I think that picture is extremely unfair what s he supposed to do run to a phone booth change into his super outfit and fly to Pakistan but I think his actions in the months and years after the attack were outrageous He used 9 11 as an excuse to invade Iraq starting a second expensive war with very limited participation from allies We invaded a sovereign nation and I still don t know why unless it was just the neocon strategy for staging troops in the Middle East for a few years while evacuating Saudi Arabia More than that he failed to lead America as if it were the greatest nation on Earth With cynical lies he whipped up a mob to go burn a witch I m not even talking about the missing WMDs just his constant confounding of the attack on the towers with Iraq ,conservative
There s no maximum wage because the market will determine what the maximum a job is worth I am not claiming that free market capitalism is 100 perfect no system is but so far it s the best we have Maximum wage that boggles my mind ,conservative
Because America won the Cold War ,conservative
How does someone who looks like that expect to be taken seriously anywhere other than Woodstock or Bonnaroo ,conservative
I see his point There is no maximun wage therefore there should be no minimum wage ,conservative
Maximum wage would actually be less than minimum wage because to be possible maximum wage would have to be the maximum a business would pay its employees for a job If a business paid its employees 7 50 an hour for a job and someone came in to do the same job for 6 50 the business would fire the first person and hire the person who would work for less Minimum wage protects workers from competition with other workers who will work for less The only place a maximum wage wouldn t really apply would be in a high skill career where you skillset is worth more than your labor If you re a scientist or engineer etc that gets paid 6 figures you earn it from your skills It s funny that whenever people demand the government make their business pay them more they re always minimum wage jobs that require absolutely no skill Burger flipping ditch digging grocery bagging literally anyone that isn t in a vegetated state can fill that basic role which is why maximum wage would drive pay into the ground ,conservative
This is the same exact thing as saying Why should poor people be able to get rich or Why should people make more money than me and my question to them would be Who are you to say that someone can or cannot be successful ,conservative
There s no maximum wage because the conglomerates that fund both parties would be outraged ,conservative

This guy could be republican arguing about abolishing the minimum wage It would be silly to have a maximum wage cap why is it also not as silly to have a minimum wage Come on guys I think WalMart workers only deserve 2 50 an hour I mean they re only opening boxes and pressing buttons on a register I think the guy who goes to two meetings a day deserves his 100 million dollar salary His ability to look good in a suit is worth way more than the workers giving the customer face time Why are the workers so greedy asking for 12 or 15 an hour in wages This would destroy the company and all the share holders would sell their shares And why are they so greedy asking for better health insurance Don t they know the CEOs don t want to wait in line behind you at the doctor So greedy ,conservative

None of it matters The political system in the US is so broken it s not even funny It s one giant cycle Executive and Legislative branch are both blue Republicans do everything they can to make sure nothing gets done All the blame goes to the Executive branch That leads to the midterm elections which now splits the two branches because people associate all the blame to the Dems because of a Democratic president Now the red Legislature and the blue Executive branch start cooperating because they both want things and they can make deals Shit finally starts happening Republicans spin it as they were able to get in there and get stuff done when in reality they were the reason nothing was getting done when the Executive and Legislative branch were blue Presidential election comes around and Republicans win because they saved the day Now we have a red Legislature and a red Executive branch Democrats start playing the same game the Republicans were playing and the cycle starts all over again ,conservative

It always seems the same to you because you re overgeneralizing and oversimplifying everything If you reduce all of world history to false dichotomies you can pretty much sum everything up to the eternal battle of good vs evil and nothing changes A lot of unique events occurred in the last 6 years and dramatic shifts in social and economic global community A lot of things are not the same as they have ever been before ,conservative

Both parties buy votes by promising to use your taxes and borrowed and printed money to buy goodies for prospective voters The goodies are different for each party but they both know that if they want to get re elected then they ll have to take money from one group and hand it to another They can take that money through income taxes fees inflation or by borrowing money that generations to come will have to pay back If you re going to point that finger at Obama and call him a redistributionist then you d better be ready to point that same finger at W because he was more than willing to hand out the free candy that was bought with my money ,conservative

The mod fixed it and has been pretty open about it He did fully explain and although I disagree with some of what he said I can appreciate his honesty and corrective measures in regards to the matter ,conservative
What He said he would defund PBS and specifically called out Sesame Street Why is this a lie from Obama ,conservative
Good to hear ,conservative
If Obama actually cares and wants to do something positive for race relations in this country he should declare Rev Al Charlatan an enemy of the state and invite George Zimmerman to the White House to formally apologize for irresponsibly impinging on Zimmerman s Due Process rights Obviously I m being a bit cynical here And of course Obama isn t obliged to do anything But something similar to the so called Beer Summit http en wikipedia org wiki Beer_Summit 22Beer_Summit 22 after the Henry Louis Gates fiasco another race controversy where he presumptuously and prematurely staked out a position remember acted stupidly might actually be productive Because if Obama wants to show he is above the polarizing racial rancor in this country he shouldn t back down when the shoe is on the other foot as it is now ,conservative
He told people to calm down and respect the verdict made by the jury His words were I know this case has elicited strong passions And in the wake of the verdict I know those passions may be running even higher But we are a nation of laws and a jury has spoken I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son I would like to see a quote somewhere that shows how he exacerbated racial tensions in our country making them worse than they have been in years Also Simon says Obama was implying that Trayvon could be his son Where is the quote I m not just gonna take his word for it And another thing how the hell can polls show that racism is at an all time low And what polls His own This article seems to be full of incredibly biased speculation And God forbid the President of the United States think about his image especially when he has so many people who are ready to build it for him like Simon Sorry this came out like a rant and God kn,conservative

Someone want to tell me who Rev Al Charlatan is ,conservative
You know what annoys me about Obamas words And in the wake of the verdict I know those passions may be running even higher Implying that the verdict was wrong and people have every right to be pissed about it Bullshit Mr president the verdict was correct all the evidence showed that fact the jury showed that fact DA who chose not to prosecute the case originally showed that fact to begin with Just like Obama did with the Cambridge police incident he butts his head into racially charged situations that he has no business even commenting on ,conservative
First of all this statement is directed at Trayvon s parents and he is offering sympathy for their situation Second he isn t saying that all black people look the same he s implying that Zimmerman saw a black guy in a hoodie wandering his neighborhood and automatically decided the guy was a criminal Even if he was acting strange the fact is Zimmerman assumed he was up to no good when really he lived in the neighborhood Obama is saying young black men shouldn t be assumed criminals based on their looks and their clothes ,conservative
also agreed ,conservative

You certainly could be right It may have been due to the thousands of outraged protesters taking to the streets in response to the verdict but your theory is good too Im not saying he doesnt think the verdict was wrong but he explicitly told people that it is what it is and to move on I think the president is more concerned with the whole gun thing rather than the racial thing As was also stated in his comment Which he was asked to share by the way And when a teenager gets shot by a man on neighborhood watch there should definitely be some sort of investigation Not necessarily a full blown trial but we needed to be sure it was self defense as Zimmerman claimed Which we found out from witness testimony ,conservative
Zimmerman said Martin was acting strange like he was on drugs Martin was found with drugs in his system I don t know how people got that it was racial profiling ,conservative
I don t think he assumed he was up to no good but I do think he thought he looked suspicious wandering around Nothing wrong with approaching a suspicious person in your neighborhood this isn t necessarily racist ,conservative
Why this one Because he was asked specifically about this one Edit Yes he didn t have to answer but he was asked point blank which is why he commented in the moment he did ,conservative

He s actually a pretty viable candidate If we nominate trump I d vote for Webb ,conservative
Jim Webb on the Issues Wells hes very pro gun Pretty much pro abortion Voted for more money for cash for clunkers and stimulus Glad that marriage has evolved to include gays Rated 86 by UFCW indicating an anti management pro labor record Voted No on COPS program which provided funding for community policing No stance on drugs Voted NO on barring EPA from regulating greenhouse gases Apr 2011 Voted YES on tax incentives for energy production and conservation Jun 2008 Pretty much not a firm believer in global warming Voted NO on prohibiting eminent domain for use as parks or grazing land Dec 2007 Arab Spring stay out if no Americans at risk Oct 2014 Voted NO on the Ryan Budget Medicare choice tax spending cuts May 2011 Voted to extend patriot act Wants to secure border Wants english as the official language Wants to tax 1 more Anti Bush Anti Iraq War Pretty much liberal but is kinda conservative in his voting record ,conservative
It is a shame he won t be in the general election He also has good executive experience as Secretary of the Navy and Assistant Secretary of Defense I d prefer him over Trump who I fear will abuse executive privilege and Carson out of touch inexperienced ,conservative
At least the commies in Vietnam respected a person s military record ,conservative
The funny thing is that he might be more viable as a Republican as the only combat veteran running and the only person with direct experience with federal government without being an all the way insider It might be interesting too in seeing a good candidate that is not a former governor or Congressional member ,conservative
I was wondering about that Previously I ve said I d abstain if Trump was nominated but Webb made me think that he might be worth a nose hold vote given the right circumstances ,conservative
While I feel some ideas trump has been brave to finally speak out on I m sure he would be an absolutely awful presidential leader Brash has ruined almost every Washington relationship already seems way too trigger happy not in foreign policy but just reactions and speech ,conservative
Interesting post Why Webb What do you like so much ,conservative
I could see Webb winning in a landslide I might actually send him a donation ,conservative
Pretty much liberal but is kinda conservative in his voting record sooo moderate ,conservative
Thanks for this He came off as more conservative in the debates but I was wondering these specifics ,conservative

My dream is that we get a Paul Webb competition for the general While they re different in many issues I think either of them would be good for our country ,conservative
He was a Republican From what I understand he switched parties when we invaded Iraq ,conservative
Virginian here Our politicians in large part are very middle of the road Democrats are put in power by the DC suburbs filled with wealthy moderate liberals Richmond which is slightly more conservative Virginia Beach which is still more conservative and Norfolk which is fairly liberal with a substantial black population The rest of the state more or less is completely red The current state of VA politics is slightly in favor of Obama and Democrats but is it still Virginia and politicians know that We don t have super liberal or super conservative people elected to be Governor or Senators Webb was great for Virginia I would rather have a full conservative in the Whitehouse but someone like Webb would be just fine I will be voting for him in the Democratic primaries if he makes it that far ,conservative
If you search back and find the Democrat debate thread many folks commented while he was debating about what they were specifically appreciating about his remarks ,conservative
I would be very happy if he got the Democratic nomination He s got the kind of experience that actually matters for commander and chief and seems to be a very moderate politician without a radical agenda and an apparent focus on getting our country secure and safe ,conservative
Well when I googled him on the issues it said he was more left than moderate but I would call him a moderate sure ,conservative
That changed a lot of minds too Francis Fukuyama who had once proposed the end of history around the time of the Soviet Union s fall and supported nation building changed his outlook based on the outcome of the invasion ,conservative
That s cool To bad that the National Democratic party has moved away from Webb Back when Clinton ran for office Webb would have been considered a real solid candidate Today it s Bernie Sanders that gets all the attention ,conservative
He switched parties as protest against the Iraq war I think he would have been elected without changing parties I have been jumping on his bandwagon but I really need to know more ,conservative
It may not look like it now but Sanders is not going to be the candidate he is not electable Anyone who is against guns capitalism business and low taxes isn t getting the nomination But you re right Webb is not liberal enough for the nomination either It will be Clinton or Biden from the looks of things ,conservative
He s probably practicing for 2020 or 2024 not knowing his age Clinton has the clear lock on the Dems over guys like Webb OMalley Chafee Sanders and even Biden are spoilers without a profound chance but the first three are nowhere near enough caliber to make it this time But you ll notice that Romney ran once before getting the nomination and Trump and Clinton the current leaders of their party nominations themselves both ran before I assume that the first time is necessary to build experience and connections even if it s against a candidate that will most likely win the round TBH Obama probably didn t expect to win the nomination his first time through then he did like me the dog that caught the car And here we are ,conservative
wait are you speaking in terms of the general election or the Democratic voting base Because banning all guns going against capitalism and raising taxes for everyone while magically erasing debts seems like a liberal wet dream and his platform is well liked my many left wing socialists and ultra liberals ,conservative
Anyone who is against guns capitalism business and low taxes isn t getting the nomination So Hillary ,conservative
not the first 10 minutes 44 of all questions asked contained the word Trump there was no debate ,conservative
The one part of the debate that I really think the rest of the country needs to see was Rand Paul s response on drug prohibition If it was him versus Hillary in the general election he could embarrass her on a huge issue for the youth vote ,conservative

I think Walker tried to do the same thing first but it was more like Let s stop fighting about Trump and let me tell you why I don t like Trump ,conservative
Yeah there were a few interesting moments but especially early on it was like watching an episode of Jerry Springer Rand Paul Trump said your economic plan sucks and you smell funny What do you think of that Carly Fiorina Trump said you couldn t be elected dogcatcher and that your face looks like an old catcher s mit Do you want to response to that ,conservative

So could Ron Paul Had Ron Paul somehow been on the ballot over Mitt Romney I would have voted for him in a second ,conservative

A lot of the stuff they all said was planned in advanced Did you expect them to not prepare for the debate ,conservative
I for one don t mind if his goal is to come off as the reasonable one Strategically I think a Kasich Rubio or vice versa ticket might be our best bet in the general election ,conservative

it s not mutual opposition progressives initiate radical change which causes reactionary forces to manifest once the progressive force is defeated the reactionaries disperse until the next time the progressives seek to alter our society reactionary forces do not exist in a state of permanence they require an initial impetus to react against i don t know why you re adding all these weird emotive expressions you re just wrong and making yourself look foolish ,conservative

Came for speechlessness Was disappointed An incredibly brief glance at this chart http en wikipedia org wiki United_States_cities_by_crime_rate tells me that Chicago sees crime rates similar to most other major US cities Also there is a significantly higher population in Chicago than there were US soldiers in Afghanistan If she s trying to say Chicago is like a war zone I d say her statistics are off Is she s saying their laws are ineffective I d say no more or less than many other US cities She focuses pretty heavily on personal recreational use target shooting and personal defense I d counter with keeping the guns locked at the range and argue that the costs outweigh the benefits more violence caused then protected from I m just glad she didn t pull the Constitutional right card Either way I remain wholly unconvinced of either side What I find most frustrating is that between all the ranting and anger from both ends there s not a whole lot of compromising being done Edit grammar ,conservative
There is no connection between the numbers of guns in a City Country and the number of gun deaths in that City Country And you would be a fool and a communist to make one ,conservative
I like to see this sort of activism reasoned well thought out and civil Her statistics are pretty bad however Gun control laws in Chicago but still lots of gun violence Chicago has those laws because they have high gun violence The question should be what kind of effect did the laws have on gun violence when they went in to place More people are killed in Chicago than Afghanistan She cites absolute numbers This kind of thing really needs to be per capita That logic is like saying the US is more Catholic than Vatican city because there are more Catholics here She does make a good point that targeting assault rifles only affects a tiny portion of gun violence however ,conservative

To be fair I have seen Obama blamed for things such as the first stimulus that were in fact signed into law by Bush Still most of the time the President gets credit or blame for things that were in fact acts of Congress or action by the federal Reserve Just like how many of the election promises made are things they have no power to change only perhaps have some influence over ,conservative

The implications that this had on the technology sector had it gone the wrong way could have meant that nothing you have with a digital interface was actually owned by you If you only use closed software with patent protections Is there something stopping someone from making a printer that doesn t limit what ink cartridges can be used I just don t get why we need to make a certain kind of transaction illegal If someone wants to set up a restaurant where you use paper plates they get to keep that s fine If someone sets up a restaurant that uses ceramic plates that you don t actually own and have to return that s also fine I m glad that both restaurants have the freedom to exist I ll admit I m not familiar with the details of the case Maybe Lexmark never made it part of their contract that you couldn t modify their printer they just tried to claim it as a consequence of their patent and for that reason this ruling had to get made I don t know But if someone wants to make a printer where ,conservative

I want Obamacare replaced same as everyone else but is Ben Carson really the person to do it I really hope Trump doesn t make him HHS secretary You know how complicated it was to implement Obamacare You know how complicated it will now be to GET RID of Obamacare and then replace it with something viable We need someone who is an administrative genius with actual government or business experience Not a surgeon ,conservative
NO you are a doctor not a policy maker ,conservative
This is key especially in face of rising premiums President Obama had a worthy goal ensuring health insurance for al Americans But his policy prescription was shortsighted and actually did nothing to achieve the goal The number of Americans without insurance is constant and all he achieved was force Americans off their employer s insurance into high risk ACA pools I m not sure what can be salvaged from the ACA A total repeal might not be the most efficient solution But almost anything would be better than the ACA Perhaps a return to the previous system but with increased entitlements for the most vulnerable Or perhaps there is a conservative solution that can help guarantee universal health care The problem as I see it the costs will increase regardless on whether the most vulnerable have insurance or not But a more compassionate conservative solution is protecting them ,conservative

Medical debt is destroying the Middle Class and the ACA wasn t enough to stop increasing premiums If there is a Free Market solution that can prevent our Middle class and poor from being chained to eternal debt I m all for it I m just skeptical that the big winners of the ACA big pharma insurance will let the Republicans destroy their profits At least with a Single Market the government can tell them to go to hell ,conservative

Why do we need a replacement though What does government manipulation get us We weren t incapable of getting treatment on the free market ,conservative
Good This is the position I always thought he would be better suited for Not the president but an adviser to the president on healthcare ,conservative
Let me help him get started End company tax benefits for medical insurance and give everyone the tax benefits employed or not It is retarded that you have to have a job to get decent medical insurance And it s retarded you have to change medical insurance every time you get a new job Allow people to buy across state lines so that the states with the best laws have all the insurance companies See for instance Delaware There is a reason why people like to incorporate there It has to do with the laws and courts there which are known for being fair and just End medicare medicaid and all government funding of medical care If people feel bad write them a big check with what they might ve gotten out of the system Print the money rather than borrow it Then they won t feel so bad When they waste the money and come back looking for free medical care tell them tough luck get a job Those people who feel bad about people who can t afford medical care can open up their checkbook and start handing ou,conservative

I know I m late to this discussion but We need someone who is an administrative genius with actual government or business experience Not a surgeon That person was Mitt Romney He had a healthcare plan primarily authored by an MIT healthcare economist That economist went on to design the major features of Obamacare which was just like Romneycare except Obamacare paid for itself and reformed Medicare reimbursements to providers so readmittances inefficiencies and unnecessary tests were no longer incentivized That last part is a little discussed component of Obamacare that s been driving down government healthcare expenditures for the past several years https fortunedotcom files wordpress com 2016 06 screen shot 2016 06 21 at 10 34 49 am png reducing readmission rates http www ankota com blog was the hospital readmissions reduction program successful nejm says yes and reducing hospital borne diseases http www commonwealthfund org media images publications issue brief 2015 may aca at 5 abra,conservative

The number of Americans without insurance is constant Actually the ACA greatly expanded Medicaid so more than 10 million americans suddenly got free insurance It will be interesting to see if that gets repealed I hope not Maybe conservatives will be more open to a universal system if a democrat won t get credit for it E g RomneyCare ,conservative
The exchanges aren t bad except than most people don t use them The individual market needs to boom for any kind of reform to bear fruit ,conservative
I think this is an issue a lot of voters don t really understand If they repeal the ACA premiums won t just magically go down to what they were 10 years ago It has every bit of potential to make people pay the same for their overpriced premiums AND millions of Americans will lose coverage ,conservative
I m not a republican but how do you think that can be implemented As I understand it one of the reasons Obamacare solved that problem is because people were required to get insurance And the mandate is one of the more unpopular parts of it I don t see how doable an Act that prohibits denying based on pre existing conditions is without a mandate ,conservative

As a republican i do not enjoy these simplistic understanding of the free market Some people not all but some are unable to work and it would be downright cruel to just let them die Just a some businesses need some form of government help to truly flourish in the market many people need a little help to pull themselves up and become beneficial members of the society at large Many homeless people are not lazy but have mental disabilities We live in a community because of the benefits we all gain from each other A business can not flourish without a population willing to purchase goods TL DR things like this make us republicans look bad and look like we don t understand nuances We do and we are not mean people We just understand that handouts are not necessarily the best way to help the population ,conservative
When the story is so simple it seems very obvious the Republican way is clearly right But that s only because it s so simple Sometimes there are more people than jobs You can t just tell a man to work if he can t get a job or there are none available Then you either let the man go without or you do your best to help him out Boiling politics down to stories like this is a waste of everyone s time things are much more nuanced and detailed than this FW RE FW FW RE ,conservative

So your operating assumption is that homeless people can t work If so you may be a Democrat Republicans are about expecting more from people They are about self reliance and the can do spirit When you assume someone CAN T do something that leads to the Democratic mode of thinking that dominates their world view and politics e g black people can t afford housing black people can t succeed in school women need Title IX to compete with boys no work requirement for welfare generous disability benefits etc etc etc All those policies originate from a world view that unless goverment intervenes and hence pushes someone else down to lift someone up these people can t succeed on their own Sad ,conservative
Just a some businesses need some form of government help to truly flourish in the market many people need a little help to pull themselves up and become beneficial members of the society at large It s sad that there aren t charities churches friends and families in the United States so everyone has to rely on the federal government It s really strange how all of those support networks just vanished over the last 30 or 40 years and even Republicans think that only government can help people ,conservative
and it would be downright cruel to just let them die As a Republican I do not enjoy the simplistic terms in which the issue of disabled workers is framed The question and choices Democrats and you just presented is this Given a disabled worker the choices are THE HIGHEST MOST DISTANT LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT MUST HANDLE IT YOU KNOW THE LEVEL CHARGED WITH PHYSICAL PROTECTION OF THE NATIONS BORDERS AND PRINTING ITS MONEY AND DEALING WITH FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS KILL THEM You have to be an idiot to think that s a reasonable way to discuss the issue ,conservative
